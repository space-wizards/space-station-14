  changes:
  - message: Mind Roles now have subtypes, which can more specifically indicate what
      role they are. For example, depending on clientside settings a Traitor can either
      show as "SOLO ANTAGONIST" or "TRAITOR" on both the admin overlay and playerlist.
      See Admin Options for the available settings. (Note, many minor roles don't
      ((currently)) have a subtype configured, and will default to showing their role
      type instead)

  changes:
  - message: The setgamepreset command no longer changes the preset permanently. When
      used with only one parameter (for the preset to be used), it will make that
      change for the next round that starts. The optional second parameter can specify
      the number of upcoming rounds that will use the specified preset. If you want
      to change the game preset permanently, set an arbitrarily high number as the
      second parameter, or preferably just modify the game.defaultpreset cvar
