      #This is a neat trick I found to sort of "hack" an emissive map into ss14. Basically, the icon-unshaded texture has an alpha channel.
      #Alpha doesn't work for unshaded, but for *shaded* it does, and by putting a shaded texture infront of the unshaded, we can dim the unshaded texture, effectively allowing brightness control.
