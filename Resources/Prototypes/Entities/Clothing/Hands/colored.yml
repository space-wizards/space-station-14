#DO NOT MAKE THESE THE SAME COLOR AS THE JUMPSUIT. It is going to cause contrast issues for those wearing the full set of color clothing and is almost definitely going to look worse.
#If you want to make it similar to the jumpsuit color, it should be slightly off.
#P.S: Most of these just use the shoe colors, so they end up having a nice "secondary" color when wearing the full set of color clothing.
