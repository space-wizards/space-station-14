#None of these besides the full barricade are constructible yet since I can't understand code, and they need to do stuff like go over airlocks / windows.
#Consider porting the barricade kit from /vg/ if you do make them constructible, along with their HP values. Or don't.

#Base barricade
#A lot of components here are intentionally ommitted in case someone wants to make barricades that are made out of things other than wood.
