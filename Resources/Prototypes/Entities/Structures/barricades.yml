#None of these besides the full barricade are constructible yet since I can't understand code, and they need to do stuff like go over airlocks / windows.
#They should probably use the barricade kit from /vg/station or something if you want to make them constructible. You should also probably port their HP values and stuff if you do that.

#Base barricade
#A lot of components here are intentionally ommitted in case someone wants to make barricades that are made out of things other than wood.
