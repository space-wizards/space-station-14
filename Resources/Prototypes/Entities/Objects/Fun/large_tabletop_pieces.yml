  id: LargeWhiteRook
  name: white rook
  description: The white rook, it can move any amount of tiles orthogonally. If neither the king nor the rook of the same colour have moved, and there are no pieces inbetween them, then the rook can be moved one square towards the king and the king is moved to where the rook previously was; this is called castling. Worth 5 points.

If it reaches the opposite side of the board, it can be promoted to a knight, bishop, rook or queen. Worth 1 point.
