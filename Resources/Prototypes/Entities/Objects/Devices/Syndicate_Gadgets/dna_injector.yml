  # Should not be a traitor item for several reasons:
  # - Changeling code is still in development, and copying organs etc does not work yet.
  # - Giving this to traitors makes them overlap with changelings or paradox clones too much.
  # - It completely makes the voice mask redundant.
  # - Unlike when disguising yourself as someone else, there is no way to get caught.
