  description: A handheld device rigged to send a remote signal to objects within a radius of about 50 meters. Within a much shorter radius of about 1 meter, the signal is powerful enough to instantly trigger devices that would normally require a countdown. Once armed, it will trigger if it is dropped for any reason.
