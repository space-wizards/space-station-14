# wanted to go for EXTREME roleplay we could apply a different color to the sprinkles
# Since it's technically an alpha layer.

# You'll be able to bake the plain donuts, then mix up different glazes for them to
# apply with a brush or something.

# Lexorin deals exactly 100, but because it's airlosss and bloodloos, you regenerate some of it during metabolisation,
