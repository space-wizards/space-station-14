# Tastes like donut.

# The sprinkles are now an overlay, so you can put them on any donut! If we really
# wanted to go for EXTREME roleplay we could apply a different color to the sprinkles
# Since it's technically an alpha layer.

# You'll be able to bake the plain donuts, then mix up different glazes for them to
# apply with a brush or something.
