# Kebabs

# Thoughts on custom kebab system. Kebab items are separated into layers. Only
# cutlets and specific items should be put on skewers, which is why i've tagged the cutlets
# among other reasons. The system would specify between large and small skewer items, since
# there is only so much space the sprite can hold. There are four "spots" on the skewer for
# items, which means only 2 large items at a time can be on one. For examplehe thought it
# you can put two lizard tails on a skewer with two cutlets inbetween.
# This system of layers and spots also means that skewers can be progressively "eaten", meaning
# that layers are made invisible as it gets eaten.

# NOTE: Rats take up spots 2 and 4 and tails take up 1 and 3. This is important for sprite layering.
