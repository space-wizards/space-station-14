# Plate
# In the future, I (Swept) want a system for putting stuff on plates and it'll provide more nutrition
# If it's on that plate. I've modified all load/slices to fit on the plate, so all we need
# is that system. Ideally, food on plates would have a system where when thrown, it would
# break the plate and the loaf would fall off.
