  description: The Enforcer was designed as a modern remake of the Kammerer design. It features new polymer furniture and an extended magazine tube. After being presented to NT it was quickly adopted as the new shotgun for station security teams, but as production lines have not yet been re-tooled to produce them in bulk, most stations have only received them in limited numbers.
