# Some things might seem like great ideas on paper for pAI apps, but have deliberately been excluded.
# e.g. Monitoring (Power/Atmos/Crew), Cameras, etc. are excluded as apps for performance and balance reasons.
# Generally speaking, if you're adding an application, it needs to *not* be round-impacting.
# Remember that pAI's are *assistants*, not players.
