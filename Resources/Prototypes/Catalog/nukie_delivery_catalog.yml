# The Nukie Catalog is -not- meant to be a "here's free equipment lmao" shop.
# Anything listed in here should aim to leverage the actual benefits of the console:
# 1. Equipment that should only be available in -limited numbers- for the Nukie team as a whole.
# 2. Equipment that should be timegated/locked to the Nukie planet.
# 3. Equipment that benefit from the team knowing it's been purchased/claimed.
# If you can't justify these benefits, consider other options: Uplinks, Starting Loadouts & Mapping on the planet/shuttle.
# NOTE: At the moment of writing the store doesn't take TC, but if you can find a scenario where pooling TC works with the above benefits, that could be changed.
