# Primarily intended for antagonists that spawn outside the station (e.g ninjas, wizards)
# Contains food and water because, unlike normal crew, we don't want to force them to seek food mid-round.
# Later down the line we might want to make these more specialized per antag (e.g, maybe wizards get a box with magical self-regenerating food and a magical light source).
