# Do not add any real tutorial maps here!
# In tutorial mode, the only purpose of the "main" map is to be lean, and to not spawn any superfluous grids
# The tutorial maps are to be specified on individual SolitarySpawningPrototypes in Resources/Prototypes/Tutorials/spawns.yml
# SolitarySpawningRuleSystem will create a separate map for each player
