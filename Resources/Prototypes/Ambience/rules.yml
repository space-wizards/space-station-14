# This is a bit of a bandaid fix. Currently, NearbyAccessRule reads engineering access from *everything,* including firelocks and APCs. This causes it to play engineering ambience in places it really shouldn't.
# It should ideally only really be detecting the access of airlocks and lockers. So those have been manually tagged with the EngineeringEquipment tag.
