  description: The book is an ancient synthleather-bound treatise with a bright, star-shaped mark on the cover. Though the pages seem to be dyed in odd hues, the ink appears clearly legible despite the book's apparent age. It's strangely well-preserved, and has clearly been stored away for a very long time.

Its pages are thick and rough-edged, exuding the faint scent of aged paper, with text that seems to shimmer subtly under dim light.
