# Shared moods will be selected at round start and shared amongst all spelves.
# These are rolled before individual laws, and are considered more important.
# Note: Only one law needs to say it conflicts with another
# for the system to prevent them from being rolled together.

# Make sure to add new moods to this dataset or they will not be selected!!!!!!
