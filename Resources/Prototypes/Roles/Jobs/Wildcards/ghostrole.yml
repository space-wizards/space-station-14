# This JobPrototype is specifically granted to any Ghost Role that does not itself have
# a playtime requirement via other means, but needs one to prevent griefing users with very low
# playtime from exploiting them to cause issues during rounds.

# If the Ghost Role already has a MindRole or JobPrototype that grants any playtime restriction, DO NOT add this Job.

# A Ghost Role may get this Job if any of the following are true:
# 1. If the Ghost Role can get access to talk on radio channels without having their words replaced.
#   - This includes being able to talk over an open intercom, even if the mob has no ability to turn it on.
#   - This does not include mobs that can have Cognizine or other similar effects applied to them.
# 2. If the Ghost Role has at least one hand.

# Note that this is not a watertight solution to griefing. When in doubt, ask your friendly neighbourhood admin team.
