Swamp Witch Font by Chad Savage
http://www.sinisterfonts.com

Created 2009, hand-lettered just after Halloween.

This is a free font, and I mean FREE. Use it however you want, for whatever you want. If you make something cool with it, I'd love to see it - email me at savage@sinistervisions.com and tell me about it. If you offer it for download on your own font site, PLEASE include this Read Me. That's not too much to ask, is it?

This font is intended for specialty and graphic uses. It will look just awful if used in a paragraph format.

FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO INSTALL/USE THIS FONT, visit http://www.sinisterfonts.com, or just look it up on Google. Seriously. Don't email me and ask - this information is easily found with a 20-second search.
