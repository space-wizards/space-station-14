# Utility Surgeries

## Tend Wounds

Tend Wounds is a surgery that allows you to heal brute or burn damage from a patient without the need for topicals.
To begin you need to open an incision on the patient's body, and then apply a Hemostat to it until the part is fully healed.
At which point then you can close the incision with a Cautery.

This surgery performs best the more damaged your patient is, especially if they are still alive. And allows you to bring otherwise unrecoverable
patients, such as the dumb Technical Assistant that just walked into the burn chamber.

## Cavity Implant

This surgery allows you to implant any Tiny or Small item into a patient's torso. To begin you need to open an incision, and then open their ribcage.
Your patient cannot access the implanted item normally, though there may be uses for this, such as hiding the Nuclear Authentication Disk.
