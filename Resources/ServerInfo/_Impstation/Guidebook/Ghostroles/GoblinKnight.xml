## Rules
Sir Gollylad is a Familiar, and a noble Knight of the Goblin Order, called upon to protect important nobles from the wild dangers of deep space. 

Unfortunately, he forgot exactly [italic]who[/italic] he was called upon to protect, so he has to [color=#1e90ff]choose someone at random.[/color] 

As with all other familiars, he does the bidding of his master, regardless of what that may be. This means that if his master is an antagonist, he can be asked to do antagonistic things. [color=red]He cannot, however, choose to do antagonistic things of his own free will.[/color]
