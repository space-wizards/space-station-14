## Rules
Goblin Stowaways are "Team Free Agents," with their team being all other goblins. 

Their sole goal is to construct "Goblinhome," a mythical homeland for all Goblinkind. Doing so will almost always require collaboration with the crew of the station, and as such, Goblin Stowaways are [color=red]strongly discouraged from antagonistic activities, particularly large-scale destruction.[/color]
