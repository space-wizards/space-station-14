# Command Department SOP

2. The Command Personnel may defend themselves and perform arrests as needed in self-defense, but may not try, place times, or perform any other Security activities except hand-off arrested personnel to Security.

3. The Command Personnel may not, under any circumstances, promote station personnel to Central Command VIP Positions ([color=#1b67a5][bold]Nanotrasen Representative[/bold][/color] and [color=#1b67a5][bold]Blueshield Officer[/bold][/color]) without authorization from Central Command.
