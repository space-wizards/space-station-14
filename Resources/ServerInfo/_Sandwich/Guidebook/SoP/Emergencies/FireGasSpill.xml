# Fire/Gas Spill Procedures
In the event of a fire or gas spill (namely anything considered station-wide dangerous), Command should set the alert to [color=#c8a404]Yellow Alert[/color] until Engineering personnel can deal with the problem.
<Box>This is namely for massive gas spills, such as Plasma, Tritium, N2O, and anything that damages the station.</Box>

1. If there is a plasma/tritium flood with no ignition, all personnel should vacate the area and turn off flammable sources until Engineering can scrub/vent the gas out of the area.

2. If there is an ignited plasma/tritium flood, all personnel should vacate the area and maintain safe distance while Engineering scrubs/vents the area and balances the temperature to a safe, optimal level.

3. If there is a deadly/harmful gas spill (non-plasma/tritium), such as N2O or any other gas, Engineering should scrub the area and ensure all affected personnel are vacated from the area.

4. Once the fire/gas is dealt with and the area affected is returned to optimal conditions, Engineering should give the all clear and Command should return to a safe alert level.
