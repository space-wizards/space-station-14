# Zombie Outbreak Procedures
During a zombie outbreak, namely defined when a virus/bacteria is confirmed to have inflicted several station personnel with a deadly pathogen, the station should be alerted immediately.
<Box>Procedures are in place for an automatic notification system, but only sound off when a [italic]significant[/italic] portion of crew or inflicted.</Box>

Command should immediately set the alert to [color=#cc74fc]Violet Alert[/color] when notified and follow Violet Alert procedures.

1. All infected personnel are to make their way to Virology/Medical to be treated, if possible.

2. All medical personnel are to contribute in fighting the viral outbreak if there are no critical patients requiring treatment.
<Box>Eliminating the threat is [bold]top priority[/bold]</Box>

3. All infected personnel, if untreatable (lacking treatment/vaccination), should be confined in isolation to prevent further contamination.
<Box>They should be vaccinated as soon as possible prior to critical severity of the virus.</Box>

4. As soon as a vaccination is available, it should be administered to those that are curable.

5. Complete zombified personnel, animals, creatures, et cetera; should be dealt with lethally and confirmed to be dead.
<Box>All station personnel are permitted to eliminate confirmed, zombified personnel; regardless of status.</Box>

6. Once the zombie outbreak is contained, zombified entities should be removed and the station should resume normal activities (switching off of [color=#cc74fc]Violet Alert[/color]).
