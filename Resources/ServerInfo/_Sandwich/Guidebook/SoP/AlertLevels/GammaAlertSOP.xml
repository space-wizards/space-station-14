  # Station Alert - Gamma

  <Box>
    [italic]Called by: Central Command. Use a Fax Machine and send a fax stamped by a member of command.[/italic]
  </Box>

  [bold]Conditions:[/bold]

  There is a massive threat to the continued safety of the station and crew, threatening the very existence of the Station;

  However, this threat is not yet big enough to warrant the destruction of the Station, and Central Command may still want to protect their assets.

  [bold]Security:[/bold]

  Martial Law is enacted. Standard Operating Procedure is suspended. Security personnel have full permission to do whatever it takes to ensure that the safety of the station and crew is maintained. Personnel interfering with emergency procedures may be detained. Security are cleared to use lethal force in response to any physical threat. Assault of Command or ERT may be punished with immediate field execution.

  Random searches are fully permitted, allowed and encouraged. Security personnel may detain any personnel refusing a random search in order to conduct said search;

  Security personnel are to cooperate fully with any Central Command Staff (such as Emergency Response Teams) in order to eliminate the threat to the station.

  [bold]Secure Areas:[/bold]

  EVA Storage, Tech Storage, Gravity Generator, Engineering Secure Storage, AI Upload, Vault, Gateway, anywhere else requiring command level access that does not get regularly used.

  All Secure Areas are to be bolted down. Secure Areas may be left unbolted at the discretion of Command personnel;

  Excursions into the Gateway are fully prohibited.

  [bold]General Crew:[/bold]

  All personnel are required to maximize their Suit Sensors;

  All personnel are to remain inside their Departments until such a point as Code Gamma has passed, unless specifically requested by Security and/or Command, or their particular skills can help resolve the situation (such as Field Medics or Engineers);

  Visitors to the station (anyone with Civilian-level access) are to remain inside the Bar, Library or Dormitories until such a point as Code Gamma has passed;

  Personnel are to follow the instructions of Security staff, so long as they are within the bounds of Space Law and are not acting against the general well-being of the station and its crew. Failure to do so may lead to their arrest for Creating a Workplace Hazard.
