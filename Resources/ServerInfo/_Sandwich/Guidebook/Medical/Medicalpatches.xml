# Patches

Patches are a simple and effective way to administer medication to a patient over time with lower risk of an overdose.
They can be made at a medical techfab and filled via a ChemMaster. They can be directly applied to a patient and will fall off by themselves once empty.

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MedicalPatchBasic" Rotation="0"/>

There are 6 types of patches:
- Basic
- Rapid
- Large
- Therapeutic
- Prefilled
- Makeshift

## Basic
The (basic) patch holds 40 units of chemicals and transfers 1 unit every second.

## Rapid
The rapid patch holds 40 units and transfers 2 units every second.

## Large
The large patch holds 60 units and transfers 1 unit every second.
However, the large patch also transfers 15% of its chemicals immediately when applied (10 units if full).

## Therapeutic
The therapeutic patch holds 40 units and transfers 0.5 units every second.

## Prefilled
NanoMed Plus machines and some medkits contain prefilled patches for treating Brute or Burn damage.
These hold 30 units and transfer 0.25 units per second, but cannot be refilled or emptied. Not reusable.

## Makeshift
This rudimentary patch can hold 20 units and transfers 1 unit every 2 seconds.
However, it can be made by hand with cloth and filled manually without a ChemMaster. Not reusable.
