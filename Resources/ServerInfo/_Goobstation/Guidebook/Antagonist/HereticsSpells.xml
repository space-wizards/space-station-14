  ## We Love Casting Spells
  Spells are your main form of weaponry, movement, and general utility.
  
  You will only start with one spell, the [color=green]Mansus Grasp[/color]. Use your knowledge store to get more.
  
  Spells can be activated using the action buttons. Many will require you to click on a target as well.

  ## Focus is Necessary
  To cast more advanced spells, you must focus by equipping a [color=orange]Magic Focus[/color].
  
  Your Codex Cicatrix will function as a focus when it is open and in your hand. It's only marked as contraband when open, and non-heretics cannot open it, so try to keep it closed.
  
  You can acquire an Amber Focus using the eponymous ritual. It will act as a focus when worn around your neck, but it cannot be hidden like the codex.
  
  Some more powerful heretical equipment also functions as a focus - namely, the Ominous Armor from the Armorer's Ritual (when the hood is flipped up).
  
  [color=yellow]Ascension[/color] disables the need for a focus.
