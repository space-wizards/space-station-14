  ## Transmutation is Key
  Eventually, you'll need to start using proper magics. To draw a transmutation rune, you'll need a writing tool, such as a pen or crayon.

  [color=red][bold]To start drawing a rune[/bold][/color], activate [color=green]Mansus Grasp[/color] in your offhand and click on the floor with your writing tool.
  These runes are highly noticeable and take up a 3x3 area.

  [color=red][bold]To remove a rune[/bold][/color], use your pen on it with an activated [color=green]Mansus Grasp[/color] in your off-hand.
  You can also freely use other Heretics' runes.

  [color=red][bold]To choose a ritual[/bold][/color], simply click the rune with your empty hand and select one from the radial menu.

  [color=red][bold]To start the ritual[/bold][/color], use your [color=green]Mansus Grasp[/color] on the rune once you've made a selection.
  You can always see your chosen ritual by [bold]inspecting[/bold] the rune.

  Transmutation Rituals allow you to create powerful artifacts, demonic monsters, and many useful tools that will help you progress towards ultimate power.

  ## Sacrifices
  Now it's time for you to grow some balls and start sacrificing your beloved coworkers for points.

  If your target's in critical condition or dead, they're ready to sacrifice.

  Drag them over a transmutation rune and invoke the [color=yellow]Heartbeat of the Mansus[/color] ritual to sacrifice them.
