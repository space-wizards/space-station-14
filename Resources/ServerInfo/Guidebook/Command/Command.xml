Space Station 14 is commanded by its Captain and a set of Department Heads, who together are referred to as the [color=#1b67a5]Command[/color] department. Department Heads are often called "Heads of Staff" or, simply, "Heads".

Department Heads have access to their own special equipment and, usually, their own rooms aboard the station. They are often wanted dead by the Syndicate and other agents hostile to Nanotrasen.
