# Disciplining Staff

As a Department Head, the efficient operation of your department is your priority. From time-to-time you will need to manage one or more members of your staff that have managed to discover an exciting new depth of stupidity or malice.

Generally speaking, a warning will suffice to spook a member of staff into line. You can also confiscate items from your subordinates, should you feel they are incapable of using them competently.

In extreme circumstances, you might need to suspend a member of staff from their role. Staff may also choose to quit their role during the shift.

Suspending a member of staff does not require a lengthy dismissal proceedure or a frog-marching over to the Head of Personnel's desk. Instead:

- Inform the member of staff that they have been suspended.
- Inform other members of the department that the staff member has been suspended.
- Remove any department equipment they possess.
- Ensuring their ID card's access rights are revoked. This may require use of the ID card console on the Bridge, or the assistance of the Head Of Personnel, Head of Security, or Captain.
- Escort them from the department.
- Inform the Head of Personnel and other Department Heads via the [color=#1b67a5]Command[/color] channel that you have suspended them. You can also issue a stamped paper saying you have suspended the staff member.

You should put any items taken from the suspended staff member aside, so you can return them to the staff member if you lift their suspension.

Depending on the circumstance, you might want to ask a member of the Security team to be present whilst you enact the suspension.

The Captain should always make an effort, should they suspend a Department Head, to fill the new vacancy with another member of that Department. Departments without a Head tend to lack co-ordination and the use of some of their key equipment.
