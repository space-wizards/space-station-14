  # Xenoarchaeology

  Xenoarchaeology is a branch of Science focused on researching alien [bold]artifacts[/bold].

  Unlocking their secrets grants research points and reveals strange, sometimes dangerous effects.

  At round start, Science usually has one or two artifacts in the lab. More can be:
  - Ordered from [color=yellow]Cargo[/color]
  - Found by [color=orange]Salvage[/color]
  - Assembled from [bold]fragments[/bold]
  - Appear during certain station events

  ## Artifacts

  </Box>

  Artifacts contain [bold]nodes[/bold] arranged in [bold]layers[/bold].
  - Unlocking a node unlocks connected nodes on upper layers.
  - Each node has [bold]triggers[/bold] and an [bold]effect[/bold].
  - Each node has [bold]durability[/bold]: the number of times it can be manually activated after being unlocked.
  - Higher nodes are harder to reach but give more points.

  Unlocking all nodes provides no special bonus, but every node yields points.

  ## Equipment

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MachineArtifactAnalyzer" Caption="Analyzer"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerAnalysisConsole" Caption="Console"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="NodeScanner" Caption="Node Scanner"/>
  </Box>
  - [bold]Artifact Analyzer:[/bold] Scans artifacts, sending data to the Console.
  - [bold]Analysis Console:[/bold] Displays and interacts with the node tree. Must be linked to an Analyzer with a multitool.
  - [bold]Node Scanner:[/bold] Shows the ID of the node currently being activated and whether the artifact is ready to trigger.

  </Box>
  - [bold]Artifact Containers:[/bold] Safely store and transports artifacts and prevent nodes from triggering.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MachineArtifactCrusher" Caption="Crusher"/>
  </Box>
  - [bold]Artifact Crusher:[/bold] Crushes artifacts into fragments. Four fragments can be rebuilt into a new artifact.

  ## Unlocking Nodes
  1. Select a node on the [bold]Analysis Console[/bold] to check its trigger and effect.

  2. Perform its listed [bold]triggers[/bold] near the artifact, which will resonate with the message: [italic]"It begins to shift in strange ways..."[/italic]. The [bold]Node Scanner[/bold] will show if a specific node is being triggered.

  3. Once all triggers are met, the artifact will trigger its effect with the message: [italic]"It slows down, visibly changed."[/italic] and the node will become [bold][color=green]Active[/color][/bold] on the Console and can be manually activated by interacting with the artifact.

  Artifacts after having their first trigger met will have a window of 5 seconds to meet the remaining triggers, resetting every time a new trigger is met.

  If an artifact's activation fails, it will stop resonating with the message: [italic]"It slows down before uneventfully stopping."[/italic]

  Order of trigger activation [bold]does not matter[/bold], [italic]however[/italic], it might in relation to other nodes. If multiple nodes have the same trigger, you may need to start with a trigger not present in other nodes.

  [bold]Manual activation triggers all unlocked nodes at once and consumes durability.[/bold]

  ## Analysis Console Interface
  - [bold]ID:[/bold] Unique identifier for use with the Node Scanner.
  - [bold]Class:[/bold] The layer name. Nodes on the same layer share it.
  - [bold]Status:[/bold]
  - [italic][color=red]Locked[/color][/italic] by default
  - [italic][color=plum]Active[/color][/italic] when first triggered
  - [italic][color=lime]Unlocked[/color][/italic] if a deeper node is reached (prevents manual activations)
  - [bold]Durability:[/bold] Number of manual activations available for that node.
  - [bold]Effect:[/bold] What happens when the node activates or is manually triggered.
  - [bold]Triggers:[/bold] Required actions to activate the node the first time.
  - [bold]Server/Extraction:[/bold] Choose a research server and extract points from unlocked nodes.

  ## Triggers
  Examples include:
  - Examining the artifact
  - Playing an instrument
  - Damaging or throwing it
  - Exposing it to gases (plasma, tritium, etc.)
  - Changing pressure or temperature
  - Using tools (screwdriver, multitool, crowbar, wrench)
  - Splashing reagents (blood, water, ammonia, etc.)
  - Killing something nearby

  ## Effects
  Effects can be:
  - [color=green]Harmless:[/color] producing plants, animals, or junk
  - [color=#00ccff]Helpful:[/color] charging batteries, creating instruments or money
  - [color=red]Hazardous:[/color] anomalies, radiation, explosions, hostile fauna
