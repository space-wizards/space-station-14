  # Core Rule 6 - Do not discuss or evade bans
  You may only contact admins and discuss bans at https://forum.spacestation14.com/c/ban-appeals/appeals-game/40

  Unless you are completing antagonist objectives, evading role bans by gaining access to, impersonating, or taking over a banned role will result in a game ban. Evading a game ban will result in a voucher ban.
