  # Core Rule 6 - Do not attempt to evade bans
  This is a zero tolerance rule.

  Almost all bans may be appealed on our forums at forum.ss14.io in the ban appeals section. This is generally the only acceptable way to contact the administration team to discuss your ban and revise it if it is inappropriate, including if it is mistakenly applied.

  Any attempt to circumvent or bypass a game ban will result in a voucher ban. Attempting to evade role bans by gaining access to or working in the capacity of a job you are banned from will result in a game ban. These bans are applied even if the evasion attempt is unsuccessful.

  ## Exceptions
  There are no exemptions for evading or attempting to evade game bans. Antagonists who impersonate or take over a role which they are banned from to aid in their goals are not considered to be evading their role ban.
