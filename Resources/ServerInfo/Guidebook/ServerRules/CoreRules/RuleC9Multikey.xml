  [color=SlateGray][italic]Revision A, 2025-10-11[/italic][/color]

  Sharing or using multiple accounts will result in punishments for all accounts. You are also responsible for any actions and consequences by others using your account.

  ## Switching accounts
  You may change usernames at https://account.spacestation14.com/Identity/Account/Manage

  If you lose access to or abandon an account, you must notify admins of your old username at https://forum.spacestation14.com/c/general/4 as soon as you create another account.
