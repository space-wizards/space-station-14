  # Core Rule 9 - Do not use multiple accounts, or alt accounts, and do not share accounts
  Use of multiple accounts is referred to as "multikey". the rule applies even if the accounts are not used at the same time, including if the old account is abandoned. All accounts may be banned if this rule is violated. You are responsible for everything done on and with your account. You are just as responsible for actions taken by other people using your account as you would be had you taken the actions themselves.

  ## Switching to a new account
  If you lose access to an account, you must contact game admins on the forums notifying admins before using a new account to connect to the servers. Your message to game admins must include the username of your old account. Creating a new account while your current account is banned will be considered ban evasion.
