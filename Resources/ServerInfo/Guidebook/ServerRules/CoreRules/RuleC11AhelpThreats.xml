  # Core Rule 11 - Do not threaten to ahelp other players or argue with them about rules
  This rule covers out-of-character (OOC) and in-character (IC) actions. Don't threaten to ahelp a player, don't tell them you are ahelping them, and don't tell them you did ahelp them. You can argue in character about Space Law, but do not argue about whether something is or is not against the rules. If you think someone is breaking a rule, ahelp them. If you don't think someone is breaking a rule, don't ahelp them. Either way, the best thing that you can do after is to continue in-character.

  ## Example Scenario 1
  You are a security officer and think someone who is causing a ton of problems for security is not an antag and is breaking the rules by doing so.

  [color=#a4885c]Good:[/color] Since you think they are breaking a rule, you ahelp them when you're able to. You continue in-character by arresting them for the crimes that they committed.

  [color=#a4885c]Bad:[/color] You decide not to ahelp them. You kill them and tell them "you're lucky I didn't report you to the admins".

  [color=#a4885c]Bad:[/color] Since you think they are breaking a rule, you ahelp them when you're able to. You arrest them for the crimes that they committed and tell them "I ahelped you so enjoy your ban".

  ## Example Scenario 2
  A mouse is using emotes to bypass speech restrictions.

  [color=#a4885c]Good:[/color] You ahelp them then respond in-character by acting like you can't understand what the mouse is doing.

  [color=#a4885c]Bad:[/color] You use in character chat to tell the mouse that it is breaking a rule.
