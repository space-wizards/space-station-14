  # Core Rule 5 - No sharing current round information
  [color=SlateGray][italic]Revision A, 2025-10-11[/italic][/color]

  This is a zero-tolerance rule. You must wait for the round to end before sharing round information beyond the game.

  ## Broadcasting
  When broadcasting a round through a stream or call, you must kick and ahelp others playing in the same round, as well as hide or delete current round information shared by others. Using a stream delay to reduce current round information leaks is highly recommended.

  Do not view a stream or listen to a call while connected to the same round.
