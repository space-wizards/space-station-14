  # Core Rule 13 - Use realistic character names, and do not use names of famous people
  - No names of people or characters from the real world
  - No titles/honorifics
  - Must follow all other rules (no slurs/sexual names/etc)
  - Usernames, objects, random characters, very "low effort" names, "meta" names, or otherwise implausible names cannot be used as names. See examples below.
  - Admin rulings on IC names are final and disputes should be done through the forums, not by refusing to comply with an admin

  Clowns and mimes are exempt from the prohibition on titles/honorifics, and have loosened restrictions on low effort and implausible names.

  ## Clarification on "Meta" Names
  Meta names are ones which attempt to take advantage of some game mechanic or game design choice. "Urist McHands" is a meta name because it is the default name used for admin spawned humans. "Operator Whiskey" is a meta name because it follows the naming pattern of nuclear operatives. This rule is not intended to prevent things like nuclear operatives using a fake ID with names that appear to be nuclear operative names if they decide that they want to do that.
