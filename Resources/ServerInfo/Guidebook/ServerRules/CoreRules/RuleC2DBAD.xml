  # Core Rule 2 - Don't be a dick
  Don't do anything with the goal of negatively affecting other players. Not everyone is going to enjoy every round. Killing someone is allowed in certain situations even though it might negatively affect them, but no one should be doing anything for the purpose of harming someone else's experience.

  ## MRP Amendment
  Do not interact negatively with SSD/AFK players. Interactions to complete antagonist objectives or duties like security searches/arrests are always permitted.
