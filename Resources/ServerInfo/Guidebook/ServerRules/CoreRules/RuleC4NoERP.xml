  [color=SlateGray][italic]Revision A, 2025-10-11[/italic][/color]

  There is zero tolerance for ERP (erotic roleplay), sexual language, and sexual references.

  Players may encounter shocking themes such as gore, drug abuse, and suicide. You are highly discouraged from adding more details than necessary for roleplay and in-game mechanics.
