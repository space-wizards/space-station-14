  [color=SlateGray][italic]Revision A, 2025-10-11[/italic][/color]

  This is a zero-tolerance rule.

  Erotic roleplay (ERP) and sexual language are prohibited.

  Although SS14 includes shocking themes such as gore, drug abuse, and suicide, do not add more details than necessary for roleplay and in-game mechanics.

  ## Examples

  - Describing gore within in-game physiology.
