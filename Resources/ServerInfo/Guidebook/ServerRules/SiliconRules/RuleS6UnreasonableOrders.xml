  # Silicon Rule 6 - You are not required to follow orders which are extremely unreasonable
  Any order which is a violation of a Core Rule cannot be followed.

  Some orders are extremely unreasonable or obnoxious, such as "do nothing but collect every piece of trash on the station" or "never stop moving". These orders can be ignored and ahelped.

  Some orders violate a Roleplay Rule. These orders must be followed if your laws require it. You are not breaking a rule by following a law that causes you to violate Roleplay Rules. If someone takes advantage of a law to cause you to do something that they would not be allowed to do because of Roleplay Rules, then they are the ones responsible for the rule violation.

  ## Examples
  These examples assume that your laws would normally require you to follow these orders. It is important to note that you are allowed to choose to follow orders which are ignorable.

  Orders which should be followed if your laws require it:
  - Recall the shuttle
  - Bolt the airlocks at arrivals
  - Drag the captain's dead body into space
  - State your laws

  Ignorable Orders:
  - Do nothing but collect every piece of trash on the station
  - Never stop moving
  - Continuously state your laws
