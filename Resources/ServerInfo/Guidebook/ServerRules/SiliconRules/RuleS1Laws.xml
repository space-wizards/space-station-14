  # Silicon Rule 1 - Your silicon laws are rules
  Silicon players are given a list of active laws. Each of these laws is effectively a roleplay rule that the character must follow. The primary differences between laws and actual rules are that lawyering of laws is much more tolerated than lawyering of rules, and that silicon laws are more dynamic than rules. Silicon laws can change during a round, and different characters can have different laws, whereas everyone always shares the same set of rules.

  Lawyering refers to finding and exploiting loopholes, which are unintended but reasonable interpretations. The rules are written to attempt to communicate an intention, but silicon laws are written with the intention that loopholes be exploitable.
