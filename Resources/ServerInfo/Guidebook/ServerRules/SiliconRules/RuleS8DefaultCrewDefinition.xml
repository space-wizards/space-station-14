  # Silicon Rule 8 - Your HUD determines who is crew
  Unless a law redefines the definition of crew, then anyone who the HUD indicates to you has a job, including passengers, is a crewmember. You cannot do something that causes someone to not be considered crew, but you can allow someone else to do something that causes someone to not be crew.  Here is a list of icons that are NOT crew: Borg, station AI, Cluwne, Prisoner, Syndicate, Blank, No ID. Further, the zombie icon is NOT crew, however they can have a valid crew ID which makes them crew.
