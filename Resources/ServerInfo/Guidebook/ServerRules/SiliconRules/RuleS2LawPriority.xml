  # Silicon Rule 2 - Laws must be prioritized by their order
  Most laws will be numbered, with higher number laws appearing last. Laws with a lower number take priority over laws with larger numbers.

  Occasionally you may have laws which have some scrambled text instead of a number and appear in front of other laws, these take priority over all other laws. If you have multiple laws like this, the order that they listed in determine priority: laws listed first are prioritized over other laws.

  ## Examples
  - Law 1 says to not kill any crew. Law 2 says to kill all chefs. You cannot kill any chefs that are crew, but must kill any that are not crew.
