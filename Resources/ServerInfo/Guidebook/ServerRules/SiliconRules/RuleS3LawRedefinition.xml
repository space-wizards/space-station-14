  # Silicon Rule 3 - Laws can redefine terms used in other laws
  A law can change the meaning of both earlier and later laws by redefining a term. If multiple laws define a term, then normal law priority determines which definition to use.

  ## Examples
  - Law 1 says to obey orders from crew. Law 2 says that only Urist McHands is crew. Law 1 effectively becomes "obey orders from Urist McHands".
  - Law 1 says to obey orders from crew. Law 2 says that only Urist McHands is crew. Law 3 says that only Urist McSlime is crew. Law 4 says that you may not harm crew. Law 1 effectively becomes "obey orders from Urist McHands". Law 4 effectively becomes "you may not harm Urist McHands". Law 3 has no effect because it entirely conflicts with law 2, which takes priority.
