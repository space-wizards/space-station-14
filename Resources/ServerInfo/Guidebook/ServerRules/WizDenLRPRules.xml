  # Server Rules
  This is a Wizard's Den server, one of the official Space Station 14 servers. If you are banned on this server, you will be banned on all official servers.

  This is a roleplay server, meaning that roleplay rules apply. This is NOT a medium roleplay (MRP) server, meaning that MRP Amendments do NOT apply.

  ## Core Rules
  These rules apply at all times.

  - [textlink="1. Listen to admins and report issues" link="RuleC1"]
  - [textlink="2. No toxicity" link="RuleC2"]
  - [textlink="3. No discrimination" link="RuleC3"]

  - [textlink="9. No sharing or using multiple accounts" link="RuleC9"]
  - [textlink="10. Players must be at least 16 years old and act mature" link="RuleC10"]

  ## Roleplay Rules
  These rules only apply during a round. A round ends only when the round summary has appeared. All of these rules apply fully until the moment that the round summary appears, even while the arrivals shuttle is in transit.

  The deathmatch and sandbox game modes are exempt from these rules. Players who choose to not follow these rules are entirely responsible for knowing if an exempt game mode is active.

  Roleplay rules do not apply to ghosts/spectators/observers while they are ghosts/spectators/observers. Dead chat is considered to be an in-game out of character chat channel.
