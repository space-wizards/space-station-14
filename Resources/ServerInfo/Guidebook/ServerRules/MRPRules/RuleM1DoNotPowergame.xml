  # Do not Powergame

  You must have an In-Character justification for your actions. The Research Director does not need a gun when the station is code-green. The Head of Security does not need All Access at shift start when no threat is identified.

  ## Examples

 Acceptable:
 - Command carrying non-lethals when there is a plausible threat
 - Command carrying lethals when there is a confirmed threat
 - Command carrying (non-)lethals they start with in their rooms at any time
 - Captain hiding the spare ID in a properly secure location
 - Increasing security (such as bolting doors, adding walls, etc) during Red or Blue alert
 - Several minutes into the round, Captain promotes Warden to HoS because there isn’t one on station
 - General situations where a character is reacting to information during a round in a way that makes logical sense

  Not Acceptable:
  - Roundstart Captain granting all heads AA
  - Roundstart HoP takes Ian to ATS because “He’s a high profile target”
  - Creating duplicates of high-value or unique items to hand off to others
  - Using low-effort roleplay to skirt the metashield
  - Bolting doors to areas to increase their security before a threat is confirmed that makes that security inefficient
  - Setting the alert level to Blue or Red when the situation does not have a need for the severity implied (this includes maintaining these levels far past when said threats have been confirmed as no longer in play)
  - General situations where a character is preemptively preparing for situations that have yet to happen in ways that logically do not make sense
