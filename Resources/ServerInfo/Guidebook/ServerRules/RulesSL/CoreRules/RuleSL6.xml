 # Rule 6 – Your Character’s Limitations.

 Your character is an employee of the space station, loyal to the ideals of the Corporation and his superiors. All characters are to be and act as if they are 18+. Names and surnames must be appropriate to the context and standards of the setting. Names and surnames of celebrities, actors, characters from movies/TV, as well as other OOC names are not allowed.

 Standard operating procedures will be considered rules for the MRP+ server, and guidelines for the MPR- server. Intentional and repeated violations of these may result in a role ban.


 Example(s) of this rule being broken:

 Talking about real life current events as if they are happening now, or referencing real life politics.

 Naming yourself "JC Denton", "George Washington", "Spongebob Squarepants", or "Billie Eilish".

 Neglecting your job to get drunk at the bar after repeated, urgent requests from your superiors.

 As security, handing out free, loaded guns to everyone unprompted.
