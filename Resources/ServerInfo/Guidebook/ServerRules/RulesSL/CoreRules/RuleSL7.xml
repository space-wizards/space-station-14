 # Rule 7 - No Self-Antagonism.
 Self-antagonism refers to any intentional, malicious action against the station or its crew. While some examples are also covered under Rule 3, additional violations include:

- Randomly attacking crew—engaging in unprovoked violence, such as beating or killing non-hostile crew members without RP justification.
- Harassing security for no reason—continually interfering in arrests or attacking officers despite having no in-character motivation.
- Needlessly sabotaging the station—such as cutting critical power lines, venting airlocks into space, or destroying essential machinery without RP justification.
- Willingly aiding antagonists—such as handing weapons to confirmed enemies, sabotaging escape routes for crew, or hiding known threats without RP-driven coercion.

This rule does not prevent non-antagonists from breaking Space Law. As willing participants of the station, they are expected to act accordingly. However, roleplay elements—such as coercion, threats, or life-or-death situations—may justify certain actions.

[bold] Examples of reasonable in-character Space Law violations:

- Unlocking weapons crates to defend against a severe station-wide threat.
- Starting a fight—engaging in non-lethal combat due to a heated in-character dispute or personal rivalry.
- Hacking a door—to reach safety or critical systems when much of the station has been destroyed or access has been lost.
- Trespassing to complete necessary job tasks after an extended wait for access.
- Using force in self-defense—physically defending yourself or others from an active threat, even if it technically violates assault laws.
- Stealing supplies—such as taking medical equipment or tools from storage during a critical situation where proper access isn’t available.
- Accepting a large monetary bribe to turn a blind eye to an action or situation. (This will likely come with some IC consequences.)
