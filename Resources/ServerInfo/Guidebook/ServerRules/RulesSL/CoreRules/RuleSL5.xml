 # Rule 5 – Antagonist Behavior.
 Antagonists should behave and play responsibly, and according to the MRP philosophy that has been laid out so far. They should only take actions that directly align with their objectives. The goal of antagonist roles is to provide storytelling elements to the round, and offer players a chance to complete their objectives while enhancing the roleplay aspects of the game. Antagonists are expected to follow all server rules as well, however leeway is given for escalation and antagonistic behavior towards their targets or objectives.

 Antagonists should not:

  - Release the tesla or singularity intentionally without very good reason
  - Mass round remove/RDM
  - Take actions outside of their objectives
  - Reveal your antagonist status unnecessarily, you are likely a secret agent sent by the syndicate, and revealing yourself should be a last ditch effort to escape, if at all.
      - Certain antagonists, such as space dragons and nuclear operatives may choose to remain secretive or play openly. If in doubt, use ahelp.
      - The exceptions to this rule: You are unable to reach your target/objective without playing openly (The warden hasn’t left security for instance.), or you have the Die a Glorious Death (DAGD) objective.
  - Thieves should not intentionally kill any crew members.
  - The Evacuation shuttle and Central Command are not to be damaged
      - You may attempt your objective on the evac shuttle if necessary, however mass bombing, plasma flooding, and mass RR/RDM are expressly forbidden.


 Example(s) of this rule being broken:

 As a head revolutionary, simply walking up to people around the bar and flashing them with no attempt at concealing your actions or isolating the individuals.
