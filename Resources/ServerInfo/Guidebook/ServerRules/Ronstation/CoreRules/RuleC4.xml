  # 4: Zero Tolerance for Ban Evasion.

This rule prohibits any and all attempts to bypass bans. Ban evasion includes any action to circumvent a server or role ban, and even unsuccessful attempts voids your right to future appeals.

You can appeal a server or role ban on the Ronstation Discord server. Join the Ronstation Discord by clicking on the ‘Discord’ button on your in-game screen’s UI or by typing the following URL into your browser’s search bar: https://discord.gg/nw2N5btCpd. Then, submit a ticket in the #appeals channel and follow the guidelines provided. Lying during the appeal process voids your right to future appeals.

Voucher bans can not be appealed without a voucher of good behaviour from another server’s GA team. 

Bans exist to protect the community and to let you learn what is and isn’t okay. Evasion undermines trust and fairness.
