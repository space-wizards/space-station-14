  # 6: Zero Tolerance for Macros, Exploits, or Cheating.

This rule prohibits any method of gaining an unfair advantage over other players.

Macros are defined as Predefined scripts or tools that automate gameplay actions. Simple macros for non-competitive tasks (e.g., emote shortcuts, "Help!" hotkeys) are exempt from this rule.

Exploits are defined as the player abusing bugs, glitches, or unintended mechanics for an advantage. If it feels unintended, report it using the ‘AHelp’ system instead of exploiting it.

Cheating is defined as the deliberate use of external tools, hacked clients, or manipulated code to gain an advantage. Aimbots, wallhacks, or speed modifiers are all considered cheating. Unauthorized access of GA tools, crashing the server, DDoS attacks and actions preventing others from playing is also cheating.

Fair play ensures everyone enjoys the game. Cheating robs others of fun and undermines the community.
