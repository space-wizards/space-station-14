  # 8: You must be capable of reading and writing the English language.

This server operates exclusively in the English language. Players must demonstrate sufficient proficiency with English to communicate clearly and follow instructions. Any violations of this rule will have immediate consequences, up to and including a server ban.

You must understand roleplay scenarios, game rules, and GA instructions. Moreover, you must communicate in English using in-game tools (e.g., chat, radio). Accents or minor grammatical errors are allowed, but you must be understandable when communicating.

Translation tools can be unreliable and are not integrated well into the game. There are servers that allow other languages and you are encouraged to play only on the servers that allow languages you are fluent in.

This rule ensures fair play and safety. Miscommunication can lead to accidents, conflicts, and unresolved reports.
