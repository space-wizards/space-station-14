  # 10. Do not threaten to use ‘AHelp’ or argue with players about rules.

This rule defines appropriate interactions with Game Administrators (GAs) and the AHelp system.

Never check for GAs using the AHelp system. Do not threaten to use AHelp or inform other players that you have used the AHelp system in any conflict. Do not use the AHelp system for requests, spam the AHelp system with messages, or act in a hostile or otherwise combative manner while communicating with a GA. Do not disconnect while communicating with a GA when they contact you before resolving any and all problems unless you need to. You will need to continue the AHelp interaction either on the Ronstation Discord or during another AHelp interaction with a GA. Never argue with other players about the server’s rules. Always use the AHelp system for clarification on the server’s rules instead. 

The AHelp system exists to resolve issues, not to intimidate other players or for wish fulfillment. Respect the GAs’ time and authority.
