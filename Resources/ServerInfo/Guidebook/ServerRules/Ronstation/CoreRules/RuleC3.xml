  # 3. Zero Tolerance for Sexual Content and Shock Content.

This rule prohibits any and all forms of sexual or disturbing content, even if it is in the context of roleplay.

Sexual content is any explicit or implicit reference to body parts, behavior, or sexual acts. Shock content is any behaviour intended to disgust, disturb, or traumatize players out-of-character (OOC).

Friendly interactions and character connections are allowed but they should never make anyone uncomfortable. Ensure everyone involved is okay with any type of character interaction or relationship before roleplaying. You must stop immediately if asked to, even if the interaction began consensually.

This server prioritizes player safety. If content risks harming others OOC, it does not belong here.
