  # 5: Zero Tolerance for Meta-Communications and Meta-Gaming.

This rule prohibits any method of sharing or exploiting round-specific information that is not provided to you by the game in-character (IC).

Players should never harm and/or help other players because of OOC conflicts or relationships. Never use out-of-character knowledge your character could not reasonably know in-character. 

Characters can not remember anything that happens while they are dead. Characters who have died only retain vague memories if and when they are revived through any method, and can not exactly identify who or what killed them. If a player respawns as a ghost role, they can not use any of the knowledge from their previous character. Players should never respawn as the same character twice in the same round unless they have permission from a GA. 

This rule is known as the ‘Meta-Shield’, and specific clauses and exemptions or revealing conditions for certain information can be reviewed at https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Metashield. Characters who aren’t a part of the Command or Security personnel on the station can only identify contraband if they examine it. 

Public live streams and/or attempting to teach (new) players are not exempt from this rule.

Meta-communications and Meta-Gaming undermine fair play. When in doubt, ask yourself: "Could this info give me or others an unfair advantage?"
