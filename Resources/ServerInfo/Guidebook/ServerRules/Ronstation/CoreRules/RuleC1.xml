  # 1: Game Administrator Authority
  
  The Game Administrators (GAs) have the authority to interpret, enforce, and suspend the rules if and when it is necessary to uphold the integrity of the game, server, and community. All rulings made by GAs during active rounds are final and binding, even if you disagree with their actions and/or interpretation of a rule.

Deliberately exploiting ambiguities or technicalities in the rules ("rule lawyering") to gain an advantage or achieve personal goals is strictly prohibited. If you are unsure whether an action violates the rules, refrain from doing it until you clarify with a GA via ‘AHelp’.

If a GA determines that you have an overall negative impact on the community, you may be banned. This determination is based on your behavior, rule violations, and overall contribution to the community.

You can use ‘AHelp’ or submit a ticket on the Ronstation Discord server if you disagree with a GA’s ruling or behavior. All GAs are responsible for their behaviour and any rulings they make, and complaints will be reviewed by senior staff.
