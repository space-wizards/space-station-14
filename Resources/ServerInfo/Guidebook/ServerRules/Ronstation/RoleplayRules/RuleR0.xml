  # Roleplay Rules:
These rules only apply during a round. A round ends when the round summary has appeared on your in-game screen’s UI. Any violations of these rules will have immediate consequences, up-to and including voucher ban(s).


The deathmatch and sandbox game modes are exempt from these rules. Players who choose to not follow these rules are responsible for knowing if an exempt game mode is being played.

Roleplay rules do not apply to ghosts/spectators/observers while they are ghosts/spectators/observers. Dead chat is considered to be an in-game out of character chat channel.

  See the list of [textlink="role types" link="RoleTypes"] for more information about the different types of roles.
