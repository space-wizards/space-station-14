  # 3: Do not powergame.

This rule ensures fair gameplay by prohibiting players from using in-game mechanics or OOC knowledge to give your character unreasonable advantages, prioritizing ‘winning’ over roleplay.

You must have an in-character justification for your actions. Never steal from your department or others in an attempt to collect and stockpile resources or equipment. Never hide or destroy objectives. Pursuing unconfirmed threats or preparing for them without a reasonable in-character justification for your actions is playing to win.
 
Moreover, the arrivals shuttle, terminal, and surrounding area, including at the station ("Arrivals") are protected zones. Non-antagonists, free agents, and antagonists cannot trap or attack players in Arrivals unless an antagonist’s objective requires it or there is no reasonable way to limit collateral damage. Never prevent people from safely arriving at the station. Do not cause people to die immediately after arriving at the station.
