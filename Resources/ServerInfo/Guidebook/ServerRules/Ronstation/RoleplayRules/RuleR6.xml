  # 6: Do not stall the round.

This rule prohibits any behaviour that unnecessarily delays a round from ending when a majority of players want it to. Any violations of this rule will have immediate consequences, up to and including removal from the round and/or a server ban.

Never repeatedly recall the evacuation shuttle or block it from docking at the station without a reasonable in-character justification. Never hide or destroy an objective that can end the round (e.g. the Nuclear Authentication Disc). 

You can always recall the evacuation shuttle if the round has not been at least 45 minutes long unless the majority of the crew members are dead or the station is critically damaged.

Prioritize everyone’s enjoyment. Stalling frustrates players and disrupts the flow of gameplay.
