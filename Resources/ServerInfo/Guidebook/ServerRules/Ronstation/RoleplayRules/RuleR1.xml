  # 1: Non-Antagonists are Always Crew-Aligned.

This rule ensures fair gameplay by requiring non-antagonists to either not have an overall effect on the round, or have an overall positive effect on the round. Any violations of this rule will have immediate consequences, up to and including removal from the round and/or a voucher ban.

Non-antagonists should never act in ways that negatively impact the round. Never steal critical items, deliberately attack other crew members without an in-character justification, or damage and/or destroy station systems. If your character knows another character is an antagonist, and is a non-antagonist, your character must never deliberately cooperate with them.

This rule does not prohibit you from breaking space law in-character if and when you have reasonable in-character reasons. Characters who are coerced into cooperating with antagonists will be exempt from this rule if and when they attempt to not cooperate with the antagonist until they have no other choice (e.g. to save another crewmembers life who is being held as a hostage, a crewmember might let a traitor in to the bridge).

Non-Antagonists are the station’s backbone. Focus on roleplay, teamwork, and survival—not chaos.
