  # 4. Command, Security, and Justice Standards

This rule ensures immersive roleplay by establishing higher standards for Command, Security, and Justice roles.


These roles are not for new players. Inexperienced players should avoid them. You must thoroughly memorize and understand space law as the game defines it. Always follow space law as a member of the command personnel on the station – you should never abuse your power; furthermore, the preparation of, or authorization to prepare and use any contraband should always be during a crisis, and never when there is no crisis to resolve.

Negligence, overreach, and unauthorized sabotage without a(n) reasonable in-character justification are all prohibited by this rule.

These roles shape the round’s flow. Lead by example and prioritize the crew’s survival.
