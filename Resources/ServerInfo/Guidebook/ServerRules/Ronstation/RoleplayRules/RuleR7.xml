  # 7: Roleplay a Coherent, Believable Character.

This rule ensures immersive roleplay by requiring players to act like in-universe characters.

This game is about working together to create a story through authentic character choices, so your character’s decisions should feel natural to the setting and their role in it. Ask yourself, “What would my character do?”—not “How do I win?”. Players should embody their characters by acting as part of the game world—not like a real person playing a game. Lighthearted or eccentric characters are allowed, but they must still feel believable. Playstyles that ignore any opportunities for participation or roleplay are prohibited.

You should only use plausible names which follow species-specific naming conventions, though honorifics and nicknames are allowed (e.g. “King Kills-the-Clowns”, “John “Ghost” Murray”). Clowns, mimes, wizards, boxers, chaplains, musicians and antagonists are given more freedom and may be exempt from the naming clauses of this rule.
