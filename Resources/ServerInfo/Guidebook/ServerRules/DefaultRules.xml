  # Trieste Port Rules
  Trieste Port is an MRP server, meaning that some level of roleplay is required. 
  By joining the round, admins will assume you have read the rules regardless of your actions ingame. 
   ex:-'I didn't read the rules' is NOT a viable excuse.
  
  ## Core Rules
  These rules apply at all times, including between rounds.

  -  Admins have final say over a situation
  -  Don't be a dick
  -  No Hate Speech or Discriminatory Language
  -  No sexual content/themes, including erotic roleplay (ERP) and no shock content. You will be banned without hesitation.
  -  Do not use out of game methods to communicate with other players.
       >this includes things such as being on a discord call
  -  Do not attempt to evade bans
  -  Only use English
  -  Do not exploit the game, use cheats, or macros
  -  Do not use multiple accounts, or alt accounts, and do not share accounts
  -  Do not overly spam or ignore admin messages
  -  Do not threaten to ahelp other players or argue with them about rules. Simply ahelp and move on.
  -  Players must be and act at least 16 years old
  -  Use realistic character names
   
  ## Roleplay Rules
  These rules only apply during a round. A round ends only when the game returns to the lobby. [color=#ff0000]All of these rules apply fully whenever the game is not at the lobby unless it is in an exempt game mode.[/color]
  Roleplay rules do not apply to ghosts/spectators/observers while they are ghosts/spectators/observers. Dead chat is considered to be an in-game out of character chat channel.

  -  Silicons must follow their Silicon Laws
  -  Familiars must obey their master
  -  Do not metagame, as in exploiting knowledge of the systems/map to gain an advantage
  -  Don't act like an antagonist unless the game tells you that you are one
  -  Do not stall the round
  -  As an antagonist, do not cause excessive death, damage, or destruction beyond your objectives. Try to avoid round removing pointlessly.
       >As a sidenote, keep in mind during gameplay that you are driving the round for others. Make it interesting and fun for everyone involved if possible!
  -  Listen to your team leader
  -  Follow reasonable escalation
       Ex: Verbal>Nonlethal(ex: shove)>lethal
           >If you are attacked, you may defend yourself with equal escalation immediately. Ex: if you're stabbed, you can stab back.
  -  Do not needlessly abandon your role
  -  Set an example if playing command or security
  -  Command and Security must follow Space Law
  -  Do not tamper with the Diving Bell or cause major flooding on purpose.

  ## Silicon Rules
  You are only silicon if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a silicon. For players who are silicons, these Silicon Rules override all roleplay rules if there is any conflict. Silicon Rules do not override core rules.
