  # Role Types

  ## Crew Aligned/Non-antagonist
  In most rounds, a majority of players will be non-antagonists, meaning that they are crew aligned. This is the "default" role, if the game doesn't tell you that you are one of the other roles defined here, then you are a non-antagonist. Overall, non-antagonists are intended to work towards a net positive effect on the round.

  ## Solo Antagonist
  Certain roles are intended to cause problems for the round or for non-antagonists. You are only a solo antagonist if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a solo antagonist. Antagonists are exempt from many but not all roleplay rules.

  ## Team Antagonist
  Team antagonists are like solo antagonists but they have other antagonists who they are expected to not hinder, and who they may be expected to help. You are only a team antagonist if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a team antagonist.

  ## Free Agent
  Certain roles are free to choose if they want to behave as an antagonist or as a non-antagonist, and may change their mind whenever they'd like. You are only free agent if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a free agent.

  ## Familiar
  Familiars are considered non-antagonists, but have instructions to obey someone. They must obey this person even if it causes them to violate roleplay rules or die. You are only a familiar if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a familiar. You are only the familiar of the person the game tells you.

  ## Silicon
  Silicons have a set of laws that they must follow above all else except the core rules. You are only silicon if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a silicon.
