  # Roleplay Rule 16 - Use appropriate names for characters
  All names must not breach server rules or exploit in-game naming mechanics.

  Roundstart names must not contain:
  - Non-familial titles
  - Numbers
  - Emojis
  - Unrecognisable symbols

  Additionally, roundstart names must not be:
  - Recognisable figures
  - Unpronouncable
  - Mispunctuated
  - Miscapitalized
  - Low-effort

  Silicon names are exempt from roundstart name rules. Stage names (Clown, Mime, Musician) may have titles and looser restrictions for "low-effort" names.
