  # Roleplay Rule 7 - Do not stall the round
  Rounds are intended to end eventually. Don't hold a round hostage by preventing it from coming to a natural end. If a majority of players in a round want the round to end, don't prevent it from ending. Recalling the shuttle or preventing it from being called can contribute to round stalling, but is not always round stalling. Leaving the station with the nuclear authentication disk while nuclear operatives are trying to get it is almost always considered round stalling. Leaving the station on the evacuation shuttle is not round stalling.

  Recalling the shuttle before a round reaches 45 minutes can not be considered round stalling unless a significant amount of the crew is dead, or a significant amount of the station is damaged or destroyed. Once these conditions are met, whether recalling the shuttle is considered round stalling or not can be highly dependent on the specific situation.

  ## Examples
  Acceptable:
  - Recalling a shuttle that was called 30 minutes into a round because people were bored.
  - Recalling a shuttle that was called because nuclear operatives declared war.
  - The crew decides to try to have a shift go as long as possible. The station is in good condition and a majority of all crew are alive. An automatic shuttle call 4 hours into the round is recalled.

  Prohibited:
  - Trying to keep nuclear operatives from getting the nuclear authentication disk by flying around in space with it or hiding with it off station.
  - Recalling the shuttle while the station is in complete disarray and 90% of the crew are dead.
