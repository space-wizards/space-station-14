  # Roleplay Rule 3 - Roleplay a normal person
  - Do not use texting/messaging acronyms (ex: "lol", "wtf", "brb", "lmao", "thx", "sgtm") or emoticons (ex: ":)", "xD") in-character.
  - Do not mention out-of-character (OOC) concepts like game admins or developers in character.
  - Do not use emotes to bypass muted or accented speech.
  - Do not use extremely low effort or impossible emotes.

  ## Examples
  Things you should not do:
  - Say "lol did u c wat just happened" using in-character chat.
  - Say "an admin exploded him" using in-character chat.
  - Emote "can you give me some cheese" as a mouse.
  - Emote "motions for you to order guns" or "asks you to order guns in sign language" as a mime.

  Things you could do instead:
  - Say "haha did you see what just happened?"
  - Say "god blew him up" or "centcomm must have bluespaced a bomb to him"
  - Point at cheese
  - Point at the cargo order console then emote "shoots finger guns"
