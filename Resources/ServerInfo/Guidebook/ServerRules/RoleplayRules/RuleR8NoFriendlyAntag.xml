  # Roleplay Rule 8 - As an antagonist, only be friendly to your team and don't work against your team
  Do not take or enable antagonist roles that you do not want to play. Solo antagonists and team antagonists are intended to cause issues for non-antagonists or the station. Antagonists are not required to exclusively cause issues, but their net impact on non-antagonists or the station should generally be negative.

  Do not cause issues for your own team as a team antagonist.

  ## Examples
  Acceptable:
  - Betraying another antagonist as a solo antagonist.
  - Revealing the identity of another antagonist as a solo antagonist for some benefit to yourself.
  - Working against the revolution after being de-converted from being a revolutionary.
  - Killing nuclear operatives as a revolutionary.

  Prohibited:
  - Buying Syndicate items for security.
  - Randomly attacking other carp as an antagonist carp.
  - Ignoring your team as a nuclear operative.
  - Sabotaging your team as a nuclear operative.
  - Attacking other zombies as a zombie.
  - Working against the revolution as a revolutionary.
  - Making or trying to make the station uninhabitable as a revolutionary.
