  # Roleplay Rule 6 - Don't act like an antagonist unless the game tells you that you are one
  Acting like an antagonist when you are not one is often referred to as "self-antagging" or being a "self-antag", both of these things are against the rules. You are not an antagonist unless the game tells you that you are an antagonist. Do not make yourself a major problem, annoyance, or disruption while not an antagonist. Do not willfully cooperate with known antagonists. Non-antagonists should typically either not have an overall effect on the round, or should have an overall positive effect on the round.

  ## Examples
  These examples assume that you are not an antagonist.

  Acceptable:
  - Stealing or breaking a glass from the bar.
  - Replacing someone's shoes with clown shoes.
  - Giving everyone all access during war ops. (This is not necessarily a good idea)

  Prohibited:
  - Starting a cult.
  - Starting a revolution.
  - Mutinying the captain because they would not let you become the chief medical officer.
  - Randomly smashing lots of station lights.
  - Disrupting station power.
  - Spacing parts of the station.
  - Distributing significant levels of access without a good reason.
  - Stealing high risk or high value items, like the nuclear authentication disk, for no reason.
