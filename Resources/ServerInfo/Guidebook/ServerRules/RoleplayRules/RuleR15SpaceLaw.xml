  # Roleplay Rule 15 - Command and Security must follow Space Law
  All non-antagonist command and security roles must obey [textlink="Space Law" link="SpaceLaw"]. This includes non-antagonists who are promoted to or gain a position during the round in any way. This also includes non-antagonists who are acting as a security role.

  Space Law violations should be prioritized based on severity and the current situation.

  This prohibits use of syndicate items outside extreme emergencies, including uplinks by command and security. This also prohibits the preparing of syndicate items for an emergency.

  When a player acting in a security role sentences a detainee to confinement, any sentence exceeding 20 minutes of confinement (including Permanent Confinement) must be supported by valid Space Law charges. If the sentence length is lower, giving inappropriate sentence lengths is considered an in-character issue, not a rules issue.

  Players acting in the role of Captain, HOS, and Warden are responsible, within reason, for ensuring security officers place appropriate sentences that follow Space Law. If they are aware of an inappropriate sentence, including excessively long sentences, and if there is not an urgent threat or danger that they must prioritize, then they must work to correct that sentence. Unreasonable failures, as determined by game admins, of the captain, HOS, or warden to ensure Space Law is followed will be considered a rules issue, not an in-character issue.
