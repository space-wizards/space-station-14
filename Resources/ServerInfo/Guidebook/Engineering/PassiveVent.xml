  It serves as a direct connection between the pipenet it's connected to and the atmosphere it's exposed to.

  Gasses are free to move between the passive vent and the atmosphere it's connected to.
  The passive vent requires no [textlink="power" link="Power"] to function.

  This vent is commonly found in the station's [textlink="gas storage tanks" link="GasMiningAndStorage"] and connected to the station's wastenet.
  It is a simple and reliable way to pull gasses from a gas miner, or to space unwanted gasses safely.

  The passive vent can be welded with any welding tool to stop it from functioning.
