  # Gas Condensing
  Gas condensers take gasses and condense them into their liquid (reagent) forms.

  For example, water vapor can be condensed into liquid water, oxygen into liquid oxygen, and so on.

  It has a [textlink="pipenet" link="PipeNetworks"] connection to input gas, and an internal tank to store the condensed liquid.

  A condensor will stop condensing gas if the tank is full.
  You can take liquid out of the condenser by interacting with it using any empty container.

  Gas condensors can take multiple gasses as input, and will condense them into their liquid forms.
  For example, if you input a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, you will get liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen in the output tank.

  Because [textlink="Chemistry" link="Chemist"] works with limited reagents in liquid form, they will highly appreciate the work of a skilled atmospherics technician who can provide them with the reagents they need.
