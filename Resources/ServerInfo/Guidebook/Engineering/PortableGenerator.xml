  # Portable Generators

  Need power? No engine running? The "P.A.C.M.A.N." line of portable generators has you covered.

  The J.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. can be found across the station in maintenance areas, and is ideal for crew to set up themselves whenever there are power issues.
  Setup is incredibly easy: wrench it down above an [color=green]LV[/color] power cable, give it some welding fuel, and start it up.

  Welding fuel should be plentiful to find around the station. In a pinch, you can even transfer some from the big tanks with a soda can. Just remember to empty the soda can first, I don't think it likes soda as fuel.

  # The Big Ones

  The (S.U.P.E.R.)P.A.C.M.A.N. is intended for usage by engineering for advanced power scenarios. Bootstrapping the engine, powering departments, and so on.

  The S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N. boasts larger power output and longer runtime at maximum output, but scales down to lower outputs less efficiently.

  They connect directly to [color=yellow]MV[/color] or [color=orange]HV[/color] power cables, able to switch between them for flexibility.
