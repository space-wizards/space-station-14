  With these devices, Atmos can insert, extract, or scrub unwanted gasses from any atmosphere they would like.
  This allows the maintaining of a safe, breathable atmosphere.

  Some of these devices require [textlink="power" link="Power"] to function, and can be linked to an [textlink="air alarm." link="AirAlarms"]

  [textlink="Linking" link="Networking"] compatible devices to an air alarm unlocks more configuration options and functionality. Otherwise, these devices follow their default behavior as defined in the subguides.
