  # Delta Pressure
  Delta Pressure, or ΔP, is the difference in pressure between two areas.
  This difference in pressure can exert a force on objects between the two areas, dealing [bold]pressure damage[/bold] to some objects in its way.

  Various objects made out of glass, such as Windows, Windoors, and Shutters can experience pressure damage if the ΔP between the two sides is high enough.
  This damage can cause these objects to shatter, allowing gas to flow freely between the two areas.

  Different types of objects have different thresholds for how much ΔP they can withstand before shattering.
  Generally, the stronger the glass, the higher the threshold. Objects that are thin will also have lower thresholds.

  Objects like walls, airlocks, and firelocks are not affected by ΔP.

  Standard full-size glass and other weak objects can withstand a ΔP of up to [color=orange][protodata="Window" comp="DeltaPressure" member="MinPressureDelta"/] kPa[/color] before starting to crack.

  Quarter-size glass, such as directional windows, can withstand a ΔP of up to [color=orange][protodata="WindowDirectional" comp="DeltaPressure" member="MinPressureDelta"/] kPa[/color] before starting to crack.

  ## Reinforced Glass and Objects
