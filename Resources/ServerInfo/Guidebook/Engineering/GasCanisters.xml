  Gas canisters are a way to store gas in a portable container for easy transport.
  They can store [color=orange][protodata="StorageCanister" comp="GasCanister" member="Volume"/] liters[/color] of gas.

  You can connect handheld tanks to a gas canister to refill them using the release valve on the canister.
  The release valve also has a adjustable pressure regulator to control the pressure of the handheld tank connected.

  Opening the release valve on a canister with no handheld tank connected will release gas into the atmosphere, at the specified regulator pressure.

  [bold]Be sure to close the release valve before you eject your handheld tank![/bold]

  ## Connector Ports
  Gas canisters and [textlink="portable scrubbers" link="PortableScrubber"] can be connected to a [textlink="pipenet" link="PipeNetworks"] by anchoring (wrenching) the device on top of a connector.
  When connected, gas will be free to move in and out of the canister to balance pressure, temperature, and composition.

  A pump can be used to insert or extract gas from a canister, useful for filling or emptying a canister entirely.
