  # Portable Scrubber
  The portable scrubber is a portable machine that can be used to scrub the atmosphere in a room.

  It is invaluable for quickly removing unwanted gasses from a room when regular [textlink="scrubbers" link="AirScrubber"] are working too slow, or when a [textlink="scrubber" link="AirScrubber"] is not present.

  The portable scrubber requires [textlink="power" link="Power"] through a nearby [textlink="LV cable" link="VoltageNetworks"] to function.

  The portable scrubber automatically starts removing all non-breathable gasses from the room when it is bolted (wrenched) to the floor.

  It will stop scrubbing when unbolted (unwrenched) from the floor or when its internal volume is full. The scrubber has an internal capacity of [color=orange][protodata="PortableScrubber" comp="PortableScrubber" member="Volume"/] liters[/color].

  ## Dumping Waste and Storage
  The scrubber's internal volume can be emptied by anchoring (wrenching) onto a [textlink="connector" link="GasCanisters"].

  Stations commonly have a dedicated emptying point to quickly transfer the waste from the scrubber to the station's wastenet.
