  # Gas Recycling
  Gas recycler is a machine that converts waste gasses into breathable ones.

  Specificaly it can recycle Carbon Dioxide and Nitrous Oxide into Oxygen and Nitrogen.

  The machine has a two [textlink="pipenet" link="PipeNetworks"] connections, for gas input and output.
  Please note that it can only be constructed with the pipenet connections in north-south direction, with input on top (north), and output at the bottom (south).

  For the machine to work, tha gas needs to be pressurized to [color=orange]3000 kPa[/color], and heated to [color=orange]573,15K[/color].
  If these conditions are not met, the gas will just flow through the machine without getting recycled.
  Gasses other than carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide will also just pass through.

  The machine can be constructed using a circuit board, which can be made at a circuit imprinter.
  It first needs to be researched by [textlink="science" link="Science"] though.

  Gas recycling can be used as an alternative to gas miners, or as a backup to build a redundancy in the atmospheric system.
