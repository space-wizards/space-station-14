  # Gas Recycling
  Gas recycler is a machine that converts waste gasses into breathable ones.

  Specificaly it can recycle Carbon Dioxide and Nitrous Oxide into Oxygen and Nitrogen.

  The machine has a two [textlink="pipenet" link="PipeNetworks"] connections, for gas input and output.

  For recycler to work, tha gas needs to be pressurized to [color=#a4885c]3000 kPa[/color] heated to [color=#a4885c]573,15K[/color], and the pressure at the inlet needs to be higher than outlet.
  If these conditions are not met, the gases will just pass through without getting recycled (as will unrecyclable gases).

  The machine can be constructed using a circuit board, which can be made at a circuit imprinter.
  It first needs to be researched by [textlink="science" link="Science"] though.

  Gas recycling can be used as an alternative to gas miners, or as a backup to build a redundancy in the atmospheric system.
