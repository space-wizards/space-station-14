  # Pipes
  Pipes are used to distribute gasses from one place to another. There are a wide variety of pipes available to construct:

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPipeStraight" Caption="straight"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPipeHalf" Caption="half"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPipeBend" Caption="bend"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPipeTJunction" Caption="T junction"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPipeFourway" Caption="fourway"/>
  </Box>

  Pipes will [color=#a4885c]automatically connect[/color] to other pipes when anchored (or wrenched) to the hull to form a network of pipes. A network of pipes is commonly called a [color=#a4885c]pipenet[/color].

  However, pipes will [color=red]not connect[/color] to pipes on top of each other. For example, building a bent pipe on top of a straight pipe to form a makeshift T-junction will not work.

  You can color pipes (and most equipment that handles gasses) using a spray painter. This is commonly done to distinguish the air and waste components of the station's Distro pipenet.
