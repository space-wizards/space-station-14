  # Expanding and Repairing Stations
  In Space Station 14, it is common for players to want to expand the station, or repair holes left by meteors or other damage.

  ## Lattice
  Lattice is bare rodwork placed in empty space. It's used as a foundation for building and anchoring objects onto the station.

  You can create lattice by placing rods on empty space using [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color]. Remember you can craft steel sheets into rods using the construction menu.

  Lattice cannot hold pressure, and all gasses will leak out into space through it.

  You can use wirecutters to remove lattice by using [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] on them.

  If the game is preventing you from placing lattice, it's because there is another separated grid too close to the grid you're trying to expand. You can use a wirecutter to remove the offending grid.

  ## Hull Tiles
  Hull tiles are solid foundation for the station, where all the other parts of the station rest upon.

  Lattice can be made into hull tiles by using either steel or almost any type of floor tile on them by pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color].
  This will convert the lattice into a hull tile, which can hold pressure and gasses.

  It is advised to use floor tiles to replace lattice instead of steel sheets, as you can craft 4 floor tiles from a single steel sheet.

  You can use an RCD to deconstruct hull tiles into lattice.
