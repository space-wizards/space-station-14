  #Air Injector
  The air injector is a special vent that forces gasses into the atmosphere it's exposed to.

  It is primarily used to force gasses into high-pressure rooms like the station's [textlink="gas storage rooms" link="GasMiningAndStorage"] or a burn chamber.

  The air injector does not require [textlink="power" link="Power"] to function.

  The air injector will inject gasses into the atmosphere it's exposed to until the atmosphere reaches [color=orange][protodata="GasOutletInjector" comp="GasOutletInjector" member="MaxPressure"/] kPa[/color].

  The air injector's speed is proportional to the amount of gas in the injector.
