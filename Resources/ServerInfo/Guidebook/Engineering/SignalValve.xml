  The signal valve is similar to the manual valve. Gas can flow unrestricted in both directions and it can be operated manually.

  The signal valve has 3 [textlink="signal" link="Networking"] inputs, which can open, close, or toggle the valve.

  Signal valves can be used in a variety of applications, for example:
  - Remote control of valves in hazardous areas or areas inaccessible to crew
  - Convenient control over a valve in a hard-to-reach area
  - Automation with other [textlink="signal-enabled" link="Networking"] machines and equipment such as [textlink="air alarms" link="AirAlarms"] and remote signalers
