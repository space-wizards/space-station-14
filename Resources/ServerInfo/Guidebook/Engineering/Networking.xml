  # Networking
  Some devices on the station need to communicate with each other, and they do this by utilizing device networking.
  With networking, machines and devices can send arbitrary data between each other.
  There are multiple networks that get used, such as the wireless and wired network.
  Each network device has a frequency it receives on. PDAs for example, use the frequency: [color=green]220.2[/color]

  Note: The following operations will require use of the Network Configurator to be performed:

  ## Device Lists
  Some devices need to know which other devices to communicate with specifically.
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirAlarm"/>
  </Box>
  Air alarms, for example, require you to tell it which vents, scrubbers, sensors, and firelocks to interact with.

  ## Linking
  If a device, basic or advanced, needs finer controls of how and which devices it connects to, it will generally use device linking.
    <Box>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SignalSwitch"/>
      <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Airlock"/>
    </Box>
  With linking, you can connect the outputs of a device, like [color=gray]On[/color] or [color=gray]Off[/color], with the inputs of a device, like the airlocks [color=gray]Open[/color] or [color=gray]Close[/color] inputs.
