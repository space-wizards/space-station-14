  # Construction

  By pressing [color=#a4885c][keybind="OpenCraftingMenu"][/color], one can open the construction menu, which allows you to craft and build a variety of objects.

  When placing objects that "snap" to the grid, you can hold [color=#a4885c]Shift[/color] to place an entire line at a time, and [color=#a4885c]Ctrl[/color] to place an entire grid at a time.

  When crafting objects with a lot of ingredients, keep in mind you don't have to hold everything at once; you can simply place the ingredients on the floor, in your backpack or on a table near you, and they'll be used up during crafting like normal.

  When placing a "building ghost" somewhere in the world, press [color=#a4885c][keybind="EditorRotateObject"][/color] to rotate the ghost clockwise. If you are building a mirrorable component (think: Gas Mixers/Filters), you can press [color=#a4885c][keybind="EditorFlipObject"][/color] to flip the ghost.
