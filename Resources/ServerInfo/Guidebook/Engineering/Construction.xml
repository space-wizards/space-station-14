  The Construction Menu is how you build and craft objects in the game.
  It can be accessed by pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenCraftingMenu"][/bold][/color].

  When placing objects that "snap" to the grid, you can hold [color=yellow][bold][keybind="EditorLinePlace"][/bold][/color] to place an entire line at a time, and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="EditorGridPlace"][/bold][/color] to place an entire grid at a time.

  When crafting objects with a lot of ingredients, keep in mind you don't have to hold everything at once; you can simply place the ingredients on the floor, in your backpack or on a table near you, and they'll be used up during crafting like normal.

  When placing a "building ghost" somewhere in the world, press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="EditorRotateObject"][/bold][/color] to rotate the ghost clockwise.
  If you are building a mirrorable component (think: Gas Mixers/Filters), you can press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="EditorFlipObject"][/bold][/color] to flip the ghost.

  You can also use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="RotateObjectClockwise"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="RotateObjectCounterclockwise"][/bold][/color] to rotate an object clockwise or counterclockwise if it's already built, as long as it is unanchored (unwrenched).
