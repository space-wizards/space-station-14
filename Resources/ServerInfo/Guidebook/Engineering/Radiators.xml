  # Radiators
  Radiators are a device that enables the exchange of heat energy between a [textlink="pipenet" link="PipeNetworks"] and the environment.

  Radiators are completely passive: they do not require power to function.
  They will always equalize the temperature of the gas in the [textlink="pipenet" link="PipeNetworks"] with the environment.

  Radiators have two methods of transferring heat: convection and radiation.
  - Convection is the transfer of heat through the movement of gas.
  - Radiation is the transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves.

  If a radiator is in a vacuum, it will only be able to transfer heat through radiation.
  If it is in an atmosphere, it will be able to transfer heat through both convection and radiation.

  Under convection, you can only get as cold or as hot as the atmosphere or [textlink="pipenet" link="PipeNetworks"] you're exchanging heat with (given the temperature of the gas in the [textlink="pipenet" link="PipeNetworks"] or atmosphere stays the same).

  If you're exchanging heat with space, you can only get as cold as space.
  To increase the efficiency of radiation, you can build radiators on lattice, which will allow the radiator to radiate more heat, compared to being directly attached to hull tile.

  Increasing the flow rate of gas through the radiator will increase the rate of heat exchange.
