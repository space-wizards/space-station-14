  # Spacing
  Spacing is the most common form of atmospheric upset that can occur on the station.

  While the damage that caused the spacing is often time-consuming to [textlink="fix" link="ExpandingRepairingStation"], the actual spacing problem can be quickly resolved by simply repressurizing the area.

  Fixing spacing generally follows two simple steps:

  1. Identify the area that has been spaced, and [textlink="seal the hole." link="ExpandingRepairingStation"]

  - If you're having trouble finding the hole, you can carefully listen for the flow of air rushing by you, if air is currently leaking to space.
  - Look for any holes underneath girders that may be hard to see.

  2. Repressurize the area.

  - [textlink="Air vents" link="AirVent"] enter pressure lockout when a room is spaced, so you'll need to override the vents to repressurize the area. You can do this by setting the connected [textlink="air alarm" link="AirAlarms"] to fill, or by using a screwdriver on a vent to manually override it temporarily.

  ## Things to Avoid
  - Keep in mind that while you have an infinite supply of [textlink="mined gas" link="GasMiningAndStorage"], it is not quick enough to fill up multiple rooms at once. Setting [textlink="air alarms" link="AirAlarms"] to fill first [italic]before[/italic] fixing the root problem will often lead to wasted time and gas.

  - Leaving [textlink="air alarms" link="AirAlarms"] on the Fill mode unsupervised may lead to overpressuring a room, which can potentially harm crew if it gets out of hand.
