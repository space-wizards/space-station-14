# Cryogenics
Cryogenics can be a bit daunting to understand, but hopefully, quick run through of this diagram, you'll learn how to work it! So, let's go over what each part does:

- Air in: Air comes in here through the distro or an air tank, giving those inside something to breathe, and the freezer something to chill.
- Gas pump: Limits the network pressure, so those in the tube aren't crushed.
- Freezer: Chills the air, and by extension, patients in the tube, so Cryoxadone can activate.
- Gas filters: Removes waste gas (Carbon Dioxide and Nitrous Oxide) from the loop.
- Air out: Waste gasses go here, either into a storage tank, or into the waste network.

Not every network will look like this, but hopefully, it's enough to give you the basic gist of how it's functioning.

An important thing to note, winter clothing (and hardsuits) will make cryogenic treatment less, or completely ineffective. Be sure to remove cold preventative clothing before placing people in the pod.

## Using the Pod
Once things have been set up, you're going to require a specific medication, Cryoxadone. Cryoxadone heals all damage types when a patient is chilled, and can either be pre-administered (with a pill), or loaded into the cell directly with a beaker. Do note, patients won't begin to heal until they've chilled to the appropriate temperature, it may be worthwhile to wait a bit before placing a beaker inside.

## Additional Information:

The standard pressure for a gas pump is 100.325 kpa. Cryoxadone works at under 170K, but it is standard practice to set the freezer to 100K for faster freezing.
