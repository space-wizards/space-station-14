# Surgery
Surgery is the hardest part of medical: fixing people without the use of magic chemicals.

If nobody is seriously injured you can even turn your friend into a pizza or implant grenades inside of fools.

# Equipment
Everything you need can be found in a surgery crate, or your medic's duffelbag if you're a nukie.

Drapes are what you use to start operations, and cancel them if you haven't used any tools yet.

Simply use them on the mob you want to operate on and select an operation on one of the bodyparts listed.

After that examine your patient to see the steps, like in construction.

These 3 are your main tools, used at the start of almost every operation.

The [color=#a4885c]scalpel[/color] is used to make incisions in the skin or organs. It will cause light bleeding, so use the [color=#a4885c]hemostat[/color] as soon as possible.

The [color=#a4885c]hemostat[/color] clamps blood vessels to stop bleeding from incisions. However, it won't fix arterial bleeding which is a more involved process.
They can also be used to extract items such as organs.

The [color=#a4885c]retractors[/color] open up the skin/muscles/whatever to let you operate on what lies within.

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Cautery" Caption=""/>
The [color=#a4885c]cautery[/color] is used to end operations and stop bleeding from some steps.

You can use it prematurely if you mess up badly and need to abort the operation.
