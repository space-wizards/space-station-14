  # Plastic Sheet Production

  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SheetPlastic"/>

  Plastic sheets are versatile synthetic materials used in a wide variety of recipes. While not inherently complex to produce, they require high temperatures and multiple reagents to synthesize correctly.

  ## Recipe

  To produce [bold]10 Plastic Sheets[/bold], combine the following in a chemical mixer and heat to at least [bold]374 Kelvin[/bold]:

  — 10 units of [bold]Oil[/bold]

  — 6 units of [bold]Ash[/bold]

  — 4 units of [bold]Sulfuric Acid[/bold]

  ## Components

  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="Oil"/>
  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="Ash"/>
  <GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="SulfuricAcid"/>

  ## Output

  Once complete, Plastic will appear on top of the beaker or ChemMaster. Transfer it to storage or fabrication systems as needed.
