  # Harpy

  <Box>

  Harpies are an avian human mutation, sprouting feathered wings and ruffled tails.
  They see the world through an ultraviolet view, slash with their claws dealing
  [color=#ec3a3a]piercing [/color]damage, and walk around on digitrade legs.
  Their most iconic ability, however, is to take to the skies!

  ## Sing your heart out

  Harpies are capable of singing out a tune on the spot with their voice, allowing for you to play music wherever you are,
  as long as you aren't muffled.

  ## Take to the skies!

  Harpies can fly with their wings to increase their movement speed dramatically, at the cost of heavy stamina drain and a temporary inability to use their hands.
  Their wings give them better acceleration if there is no gravity on the station, but they still can't move without equipment when floating out in space.

  ## Weaknesses

  Due to their digitrade legs, they are unable to wear any type of footwear. Harpies also breathe [color=#1e90ff]3 times faster[/color] than other races.
  They take 15% more brute damage.
  They are very lightweight, making it hard for them to pull any other species. However, they also run 10% faster than other species.
