  # Diona

  They can't wear shoes, but are not slowed by Kudzu.
  They get hungry and thirsty slower.
  Their "blood" is normal water and can't be metabolised from Iron.
  Being plants, Weed Killer poisons them, while Robust Harvest heals them (but not without risk when overused!)

  They take [color=#1e90ff]30% less Blunt damage and 20% less Slash damage[/color];
  but [color=#ffa500]50% more Heat damage, 20% more Shock damage, and they can easily
  catch on fire when receiving enough Heat damage from *any* source.[/color]

  ## Make Like A Tree And Leave

  Being exposed to too much Robust Harvest will cause a Diona to grow out of control, turning into an immobile tree (dropping all their equipment).
  Cutting down the tree will "restore" the Diona to their mobile state.

  ## Diona Nymphs

  After death, a Diona can voluntarily destroy their own body, releasing their "internal organs" as three Nymphs,
  with the player taking control of the Brain Nymph.
  It can talk but has no hands or inventory, and can't do much.

  After 10 minutes, a Nymph can reform into a whole Diona. This will be a new randomised body with a random name,
  and there will be little to no evidence beyond their word about who they were before.
