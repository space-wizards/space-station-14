  They can eat cotton, fabrics and clothing, but virtually none of the food that others would consider "edible". They prefer a somewhat lower temperature range than humans.
  Their Insect Blood can't be metabolised from Iron like normal blood.

  Their wings give them better acceleration if there is no gravity on the station, but they still can't move without equipment when floating out in space.
