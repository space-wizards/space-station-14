  Vulpkanin, due to their dense fur, [color=#1e90ff]prefer colder temperatures[/color] and [color=#ffa500]heat up faster.[/color]
  Their agile (but clumsy) legs allow them to leap short distances, be careful not to bump into anything!

  Their diet allows them to safely eat raw meat but they get poisoned by theobromine.

  Their weirdly shaped muzzle leads to difficulties drinking, making them sometimes spill small amounts of whatever they drank onto the ground.

  They take [color=#1e90ff]15% less Cold damage[/color] but [color=#ffa500]15% more Heat damage.[/color].
