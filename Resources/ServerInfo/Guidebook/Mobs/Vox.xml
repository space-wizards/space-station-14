  [color=#ffa500]Warning! This species is not recommended for new players due to their fatal allergy to oxygen![/color]

  Vox breathe nitrogen, and [color=#ffa500] oxygen is toxic to them.[/color]
  Unfortunately, space stations tend to be full of oxygen,
  so Vox must use an internal nitrogen supply at almost all times to avoid fatal exposure.

  Vox always spawn wearing working nitrogen internals equipment.
  A spare breathing mask and an emergency nitrogen canister is provided in their survival box.

  In addition to regular foods, Vox can also eat various snack packaging, banana peels, eggshells, and raw meat without any ill effects. They also like to drink welding fuel.

  Vox [color=#1e90ff]passively recover more damage types[/color] than other species,
  Vox also passively recover damage at under [color="31e90ff]50 total points[/color], unlike other species' [color=#ffa500]20 total.[/color]
  This allows them to endure breathing in a standard station atmosphere for 90 or so seconds, which takes them roughly 260 seconds to recover from,
  letting them quickly eat, drink, take oral medication, and so on; as well as recovering from miscellaneous damages on their own.
  Vox deal Slash damage with their unarmed attack.
