  [color=#ffa500]Caution! This species has a severely limiting game mechanic and is not recommended for new players. [/color]

  They breathe nitrogen, and [color=#ffa500] oxygen is very toxic to them.[/color]
  They need to be on internals at all times to avoid being poisoned by the station's oxygen.
  Eating or drinking will require you to remove your breath mask, although injecting liquid food is an option.

  Their unarmed claw attacks deal Slash damage instead of Blunt.
