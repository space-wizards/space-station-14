  </Box>
  small, upright, raptor-like creatures with four ears.
  Their thin tail is still strong enough to pull things without needing their hands for assistance.

  ## Sounds
  Resomi make sounds akin to common bird noises found on Earth, such as chirping and squawking.

  ## Nightvision
  Resomi have a innate nightvision given to them by their eyes.
  This allows them to see in pure darkness farther than any normal handheld lightsource would provide.
  They will have normal vision when wearing any equipment that provides flash immunity.
  Using HUD variants allows you to keep your innate vision, at the cost of losing flash immunity.
  You can configure if you start with glasses or HUD in the loadouts for all relevant roles.

  ## Flash Duration
  Due to their eyes being more sensitive to light, Resomi will be stunned for a longer duration when flashed.
  Flashes will take [color=yellow]2[/color] times as long as normal for other species, lasting up to [color=#ffa500]10[/color] seconds in the case of a localized flash.
  
  ## Health
  Resomi have lower health due to their small stature, falling into a critical state at [color=#ffa500]85[/color] points of damage and dying at [color=#ffa500]170[/color] points of damage.
  Resomi also prefer colder temperatures compared to humans, being roughly akin to Moths.
  
  ## Claw attack
  Resomi are able to slash at others with their claws.
  These attacks deal [color=red]5[/color] points of Slash damage with a hit rate that is the same as humans fists attack.
  
  ## Weapon Knockback
  Resomi have a few downsides to using large caliber weapons, and as such take so much knockback from them that they get pushed around.
  In general, the weapons that will give you knockback are [color=yellow]Rifles, Sniper Rifles, Shotguns, LMGs, HMGs, and Grenade Launchers.[/color]
  Look out especially on Rocket launchers, as since they are recoil-less, you will actually get [color=red]pulled forward with the rocket[/color] for a short distance.
  The safest weapons to use that will give you no knockback are [color=green]Pistols and SMGs[/color]

  ## Jumping
  Resomi are able to jump, allowing them to move around station hallways quickly, and to jump ahead of others in a chase.
  This ability has a cooldown of [color=yellow]30[/color] seconds between uses.
  If the Resomi is dragging anything and trys to jump, the object will hold them back accordingly, leading to most of the time the Resomi jumping in place.
