  # Controls

  <Box>You can change your keybinds at any time here:</Box>
  <Box Orientation="Vertical"><CommandButton Text="ui-options-tab-controls" Command="options 2"/></Box>

  ## Interface
  At the top left you'll see all the [bold]menu buttons[/bold] with their corresponding hotkeys.
  Take a look at what they do, especially the emotes menu.
  Notably, the [color=red]Admin Help[/color] ([italic]ahelp[/italic]) menu button will become [color=red][bold]red[/bold][/color] if an admin is trying to contact you.

  ### Action bar
  Below the menu buttons, there's the [bold]action bar[/bold] that shows buttons for generic and equipment-dependent [color=cyan]actions[/color] your character can perform.
  Hover over them to learn their function.

  It's also a [bold]hotbar[/bold] — perform those actions by pressing their corresponding [color=yellow][bold]number keys[/bold][/color] on your keyboard.
  Rearrange them by [bold]dragging[/bold] one icon over another, or remove icons temporarily by dragging them away.

  ### Status bar
  Below the chat window on the right, there's the [bold]status bar[/bold] showing your character's statuses.
  As with the action bar, hover over those icons to see what they mean.

  Some of those icons can also be clicked.
  For example, if your character ever [color=orangered]catches on fire[/color], a fire icon will appear.
  You would click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] on it to [color=cyan]drop and roll[/color].
  The same applies to [color=cyan]breaking handcuffs[/color] if you need to escape restraint.

  ### Inventory bar
  Along the bottom you’ll find the [bold]inventory bar[/bold] that contains all the icons related to your equipment and storage, left to right:
  - [color=cyan]clothing inventory[/color] (bottom left corner) — opened with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenInventoryMenu"][/bold][/color] — has slots for eyes, head, neck, face, ears, body, external, hands, and shoes,
  - [bold]PDA[/bold] slot — used to store a usable PDA that holds an ID and a pen,
  - [bold]belt[/bold] slot — used for toolbelts and jetpacks,
  - [bold]back[/bold] slot — normally used for satchels, backpacks and duffel bags, but it can also store medium to large weapons, and full-sized air tanks.
  - [bold]hand[/bold] slots — you can think of them as transfer slots,
  - [bold]pocket[/bold] slots — useful for storing small items for easy access,
  - [bold]suit storage[/bold] slot — usable only when wearing a space suit, hardsuit or armor.
  Meant for air tanks and jetpacks, but can also hold guns.

  [italic]Note: non-humanoid species may have slightly different slots.[/italic]

  ## Movement
  To move your character around, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveUp"][keybind="MoveLeft"][keybind="MoveDown"][keybind="MoveRight"][/bold][/color].

  Carried objects and afflictions influence your movement speed, but you can also hold [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Walk"][/bold][/color] to [color=cyan]walk[/color].
  This reduces your speed and helps you avoid [color=cyan]slipping[/color] and falling over when walking over slippery hazards like banana peels or spills.
  \n[italic]Note: walking can be switched to a [bolditalic]toggle[/bolditalic] in the controls menu.[/italic]

  ### Spacewalks
  If you find yourself in [color=#EB2D3A]zero gravity[/color], you'll still be able to move — although with reduced friction — as long as you're within reach of any structure.

  If you drift completely off station and into [color=#EB2D3A]space[/color], you'll need to use the laws of motion, such as by [bold]throwing[/bold] objects in the opposite direction.

  ## Hands
  Your character’s hands are represented by [bold]hand slots[/bold], which are centered along the bottom of the screen.
  - One of your hands is always the [color=cyan]active hand[/color].
  - [color=cyan]Swap[/color] hands with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SwapHands"][/bold][/color] to control which one is active.
  - [color=cyan]Take[/color] items into your active, empty hand with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color].
  - Use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] to [color=cyan]put[/color] a held item from your active hand somewhere else, or to [color=cyan]use it[/color] on something or someone, depending on the context.
  - Pay attention to your active hand when interacting with the world to prevent accidentally using held items.

  [bold]Items cannot be transferred by drag and drop.[/bold]

  ### Dropping and throwing
  Use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Drop"][/bold][/color] to [color=cyan]drop[/color] (or place) an item from your hand within arm's reach.
  \n[color=cyan]Throw[/color] items to your cursor with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ThrowItemInHand"][/bold][/color].

  ### Pulling and pushing
  You can pull movable [bold]entities[/bold] — items, objects, and mobs such as players, as long as you have an empty hand.
  - Use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="TryPullObject"][/bold][/color] to start [color=cyan]pulling[/color].
  - [color=cyan]Push[/color] pulled entities to your cursor with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MovePulledObject"][/bold][/color].
  - To [color=cyan]release[/color], press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ReleasePulledObject"][/bold][/color] or pull the same entity again.

  You can also use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Drop"][/bold][/color] to release pulled entities from your active hand.

  ## Interactions
  The game features [bold]six[/bold] types of context-sensitive interactions, accessible through different methods.

  ### Standard and alternative
  Clicking [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] performs [color=cyan]standard interactions[/color].
  They heavily depend on the item you're holding and what you click on.

  Standard interactions range from clicking [bold]tables[/bold] to put held items onto them, to [bold]using[/bold] objects in the world with empty hands, and most commonly, using held items to interact with mobs and with other items.

  In some situations, you can directly [color=cyan]swap items[/color] by clicking on a machine while holding an item.
  For example, while holding a beaker, click on a machine storing another beaker. This also works with air tanks and canisters.

  Some items have [color=cyan]alternative interactions[/color] — use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] to [bold]lock[/bold] lockers, [bold]eject[/bold] subitems such as batteries from other items, etc.

  ### Activation
  Interact with objects such as containers even when your hands are full by performing [color=cyan]activation interactions[/color] with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].
  This allows you to, for example, [bold]open containers[/bold] without picking them up, [bold]open doors[/bold] without using the item you're holding, and to [bold]cycle guns[/bold].

  Notably, press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] on a mob to open the [color=cyan]strip menu[/color], allowing you to view their inventory — which lets you try to take off or steal items from them.

  ### In-hand
  Many items also have [color=cyan]use-in-hand interactions[/color], such as [bold]opening[/bold] bottles, [bold]wielding[/bold] two-handed guns and big melee weapons with both hands (clubs, spears, axes, mops, shotguns, etc.), [bold]cycling[/bold] guns, or [bold]toggling[/bold] syringes between injecting and drawing.

  You may just perform in-hand interactions by clicking [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] or [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] on your active hand, but it's worth remembering the hotkeys — [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] for [color=cyan]standard[/color] and [color=cyan]alternative[/color] in-hand interactions, respectively.

  ### Click and drag
  You can "use" an entity on another entity by dragging one onto another with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color]. (Not to be confused with [italic]pulling[/italic].)

  Use it to:
  - [color=cyan]Place[/color] or force a mob (player or NPC) on a chair, bed, into a cryogenic chamber, disposal unit, etc.

  - [color=cyan]Climb[/color] yourself onto a table — you can also click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] on the table.

  - Open the [color=cyan]strip menu[/color] by dragging another mob onto your character — which is also doable with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color], as mentioned earlier.

  - [color=cyan]Pour[/color] the contents of a liquid container (janitorial trolley, bucket, beaker) into another container, a drain, a machine, etc. But first, remember to place the container on the ground — you can't do it from your inventory.

  ### Pointing
  Use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Point"][/bold][/color] to [color=cyan]point[/color] at a location in the world, creating a temporary arrow visible to everyone.

  ### Conclusion
  The main interactions are:
  - [bolditalic]standard[/bolditalic] ([color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color]),
  - [italic]alternative[/italic] ([color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color]),
  - [bold]activation[/bold] ([color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color]),
  - [bolditalic]use-in-hand[/bolditalic] ([color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color]),
  - [italic]alternative use-in-hand[/italic] ([color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color]),
  - click and drag.

  Don't worry about having to memorize them — they're usually intuitive and consistent across entity categories, and you'll find that most entities only use one or two interactions.

  [bold]Items stored in containers are still interactable.[/bold]

  ## Context menus
  Click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="UIRightClick"/][/bold][/color] on any interactive entity to open the [color=cyan]context menu[/color], which shows you additional interaction you can currently perform.
  The context menu can offer interactions such as:
  - [bold]transferring all contents[/bold] from a container held in your active hand to another container,
  - [bold]splitting item stacks[/bold] using presets,
  - choosing more precise [bold]transfer amounts[/bold] for chemicals,
  - showing [bold]deconstruction steps[/bold] for objects.

  If you click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="UIRightClick"/][/bold][/color] on a pile of items, you'll open the [color=cyan]entity menu[/color], listing overlapping entities you can interact with normally.

  ### Examining
  If you're ever unsure about any entity, whether it's an object or a mob, [color=cyan]examine[/color] it with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ExamineEntity"][/bold][/color].
  You can also examine items listed in the entity menu.

  Besides viewing the entity's description, you'll see some icons in the bottom right of the menu:
  - a question mark icon that links to the appropriate guidebook section,
  - a lightning icon to view the item's statistics,
  - a heart icon to view a mob's health,
  - and more.

  ## Inventory and clothing
  All items can be equipped/unequipped by using [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] on the appropriate slot.

  The easiest way to [color=cyan]wear[/color] (or equip) a piece of clothing is to [color=cyan]use[/color] it in your active hand with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color].
  Some items don't support this, so you may need to [color=cyan]manually equip them[/color] them in the appropriate slot.

  [bold]Some clothes have internal inventories and behave like containers.[/bold]

  ### Item stacks
  To [color=cyan]halve[/color] a stack of items, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].

  ### Back and belt slots
  If you have a bag or a belt, open their inventories with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] or by clicking the mini-icons in the [bold]bottom right[/bold] of their icons.
  You can also use the [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenBackpack"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenBelt"][/bold][/color] hotkeys for that.

  ### Smart-equipping
  You can [color=cyan]quick-move[/color] items between your active hand and a corresponding slot. If that slot has a container in it, this action will [color=cyan]quick-store[/color] or [color=cyan]quick-take[/color] the most recent item from that container (signified with a golden star icon in the container).

  - [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipBackpack"][/bold][/color] smart-equips the back slot.
  - [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipBelt"][/bold][/color] smart-equips the belt slot.
  - [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipPocket1"][/bold][/color], [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipPocket2"][/bold][/color], and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipSuitStorage"][/bold][/color] smart-equip the left pocket, right pocket, and suit storage slots, respectively.

  ### Organizing grid inventories
  [color=cyan]Rearrange[/color] items by dragging them with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveStoredItem"][/bold][/color].
  While dragging, [color=cyan]rotate[/color] them with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="RotateStoredItem"][/bold][/color].

  Click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SaveItemLocation"][/bold][/color] on an item inside a container to [color=cyan]save[/color] its position, so it always goes back to that position when stored.
  View saved positions by [color=yellow][bold]hovering[/bold][/color] over items.

  ## Camera
  [color=cyan]Zoom[/color] the camera with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ZoomIn"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ZoomOut"][/bold][/color] and reset with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ResetZoom"][/bold][/color].
  \n[color=cyan]Rotate[/color] it with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraRotateLeft"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraRotateRight"][/bold][/color] and reset with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraReset"][/bold][/color].
  \n[italic]Note: maps are generally designed to be played with the default camera rotation.[/italic]
