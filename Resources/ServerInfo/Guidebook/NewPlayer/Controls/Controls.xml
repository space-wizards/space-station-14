<Box Orientation="Vertical"><CommandButton Text="ui-options-tab-controls" Command="options 2"/></Box>

## Movement
To move around, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveUp"][keybind="MoveLeft"][keybind="MoveDown"][keybind="MoveRight"][/bold][/color].

If you run onto slippery objects (soap, banana peels) or liquids spilt on the ground, you'll [color=cyan]slip[/color] and become momentarily stunned.
Hold [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Walk"][/bold][/color] to walk slowly and prevent slipping on most of them, except for the slippiest ones (oil).
(Note: you can switch walking to a [color=cyan]toggle[/color] in the controls menu.)

You can [color=cyan]pull[/color] [bold]entities[/bold] (items, objects, and mobile entities (mobs) such as players).
To start pulling, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="TryPullObject"][/bold][/color] on any movable, unanchored entity.
While pulling, you can [color=cyan]push[/color] the entity to your cursor with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MovePulledObject"][/bold][/color].
To [color=cyan]let go[/color], press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ReleasePulledObject"][/bold][/color] or pull the same entity again.
(Note: you can also use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Drop"][/bold][/color] to let go with your active hand.)

You may find yourself in a situation with [color=#EB2D3A][bold]low gravity[/bold][/color].
You'll be able to control movement direction as long as you're within reach of any structure.
If you end up completely off-station in space, you'll need to [bold]throw objects[/bold] or [bold]spray a fire-extinguisher[/bold] to propel yourself according to the laws of motion.

## Hands
Your [color=cyan]hand slots[/color] are at the bottom center of your game window.
[color=cyan]Pick up[/color] holdable items into your active hand with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] — make sure it's [bold]empty[/bold] first.
[color=cyan]Swap[/color] between hands with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SwapHands"][/bold][/color] to control which one is active.
Pay attention to the active hand when using item-related hotkeys — they only affect that hand.

Use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Drop"][/bold][/color] to [color=cyan]drop[/color] (place) an item from your hand within arm's reach.
You can also [color=cyan]throw[/color] it to your cursor with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ThrowItemInHand"][/bold][/color], which has a much higher range than dropping.

## Inventory
Your [color=cyan]inventory bar[/color] consists of all the icons at the bottom of your game window.
Left to right, it has the [bold]clothing inventory[/bold] icon in the left corner, then slots for the PDA, belt, bag, hands, pockets, and back/special.
(Note: this may be slightly different for nonhumanoid races.)

The [color=cyan]clothing inventory[/color] (press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenInventoryMenu"][/bold][/color] or click on it) has slots for eyes, head, neck, face, ears, body, external, hands, and shoes.
If you want to [color=cyan]wear[/color] a piece of equipment: have it in your active hand, then press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] or click on it.
Alternatively, click the appropriate slot.
De-equip items by clicking on them.

You [bold]can't[/bold] swap items directly while already holding something. You need an empty hand to take any item.

You can quickly access your equipped bag and belt using the [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenBackpack"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenBelt"][/bold][/color] hotkeys, respectively.
Alternatively, you can open them by using [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] on their slots or by clicking the mini icons in the [bold]bottom right[/bold] of their icons.

[color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipBackpack"][/bold][/color] stores the item from your active hand into your bag, or if your hand is empty, takes the most recent item from the bag into your hand.
[color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipBelt"][/bold][/color] does the same with your belt, making tool access faster.

You can [color=cyan]drag[/color] items from one spot to another [bold]within the same container[/bold] by using [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveStoredItem"][/bold][/color], and [color=cyan]rotate[/color] them on the grid with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="RotateStoredItem"][/bold][/color].
Clicking [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveStoredItem"][/bold][/color] on an item in a container will just [color=cyan]take it out[/color].

To [color=cyan]halve[/color] a stack of items, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].

## Interactions
Clicking [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] performs standard interactions.
They depend on the item you're holding and what you click on.

Some items have [color=cyan]alternative interactions[/color]. Use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] to lock lockers, eject sub-items from other items, etc.

Many items have [color=cyan]use-in-hand interactions[/color], such as opening a bottle, reloading a gun or switching to holding an axe with both hands.
To activate or use a held item, press the [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] hotkey or click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] on it.
The alternative interactions are [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].

You can interact with objects even when your hands are full.
Perform [color=cyan]activation interactions[/color] by pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].
This allows you to interact with the world without picking items up and without using the items you're holding.
(Note: the alternative interaction is still [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].)

You can also perform regular interactions with items stored in an inventory.

As you see, the game features [bold]three[/bold] main types of context-sensitive interactions accessible through different methods.
You can always click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="UIRightClick"/][/bold][/color] on an interactive entity to open the [color=cyan]context menu[/color].
This menu displays [bolditalic]standard[/bolditalic], [bold]activation[/bold], [italic]alternative[/italic] (usually formatted like that), and any other possible interactions all in one list.
If you use it on a pile of items, you'll open the [color=cyan entity menu[/color], listing all ovelapping items.

If you're ever unsure about any entity, whether it's an object or a mob, you can [color=cyan]examine[/color] it with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ExamineEntity"][/bold][/color].
You can also do that while browsing a list of entities ([color=yellow][bold][keybind="UIRightClick"/][/bold][/color]).
This opens a window displaying the entity's name, a brief description, relevant details, and sometimes a link to the guidebook that looks like a circle with a question mark.

## Drag and drop
The action of "using" mobs incorporates a unique type of interaction: pressing and holding [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color].
Not to be confused with [italic]pulling[/italic].

- Drag a mob onto a chair, a bed or objects like the medical scanner to place them onto it.
 
- Drag yourself onto a table to climb it (also doable with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color]).
  
- Drag another player onto yourself to open the [bold]strip menu[/bold], allowing you to take their equipment (you can also use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color]).

## Camera
The camera can [color=cyan]zoom[/color] in and out with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ZoomIn"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ZoomOut"][/bold][/color] and can be reset with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ResetZoom"][/bold][/color].
Similarly, you can [color=cyan]rotate[/color] it left and right with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraRotateLeft"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraRotateRight"][/bold][/color] and reset it with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraReset"][/bold][/color].
