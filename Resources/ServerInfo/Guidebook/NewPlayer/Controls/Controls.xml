  <Box Orientation="Vertical"><CommandButton Text="ui-options-tab-controls" Command="options 2"/></Box>

  ## Movement
  To move your character around, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveUp"][keybind="MoveLeft"][keybind="MoveDown"][keybind="MoveRight"][/bold][/color].

  Movement speed is affected by carried objects and afflictions, but you can also hold [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Walk"][/bold][/color] to [color=cyan]walk[/color] slower.
  This helps you avoid [color=cyan]slipping[/color] and falling over when walking over hazards.
  \n[italic]Note: walking can be switched to a [bolditalic]toggle[/bolditalic] in the controls menu.[/italic]

  ### Spacewalks
  If you find yourself in [color=#EB2D3A]zero gravity[/color], you'll still be able to control your movement as long as you're within reach of any structure.
  But if you drift completely off station and into [color=#EB2D3A][bold]space[/bold][/color], you'll need to [bold]throw objects[/bold] in the opposite direction or [bold]spray a fire extinguisher[/bold] to propel yourself.

  ## Hands
  Your character’s hands are represented by [bold]hand slots[/bold], which are centered along the bottom of the screen.
  One of your hands is always the [color=cyan]active hand[/color].
  \n[color=cyan]Take[/color] items into your active, empty hand with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color].
  \n[color=cyan]Swap[/color] between hands with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SwapHands"][/bold][/color] to control which one is active.
  \n[italic]Tip: pay attention to your active hand when interacting with the world to prevent accidents.[/italic]

  ### Dropping and Throwing
  Use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Drop"][/bold][/color] to [color=cyan]drop[/color] (or place) an item from your hand within arm's reach.
  \n[color=cyan]Throw[/color] items to your cursor with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ThrowItemInHand"][/bold][/color].
  \n[italic]Note: you can also use [color=yellow][bolditalic][keybind="Drop"][/bolditalic][/color] to release pulled entities.[/italic]

  ### Pulling and Pushing
  Use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="TryPullObject"][/bold][/color] to start [color=cyan]pulling[/color] movable [bold]entities[/bold] — items, objects, and mobs such as players.
  \nWhile pulling an entity, you can [color=cyan]push[/color] it to your cursor with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MovePulledObject"][/bold][/color].
  This will prove useful for objects that are too heavy to carry.
  \nTo [color=cyan]release[/color], press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ReleasePulledObject"][/bold][/color] or pull the same entity again.

  ## Inventory
  Positioned around the hand slots, you’ll find the [color=cyan]inventory bar[/color], which contains all the icons related to your equipment and storage.
  \nIt includes the [bold]clothing inventory[/bold] icon in the left corner, followed by slots for your [bold]PDA[/bold], [bold]belt[/bold], and the [bold]back[/bold] slot (for bags, guns, etc.)
  On the right side, you'll find your [bold]pockets[/bold], useful for storing items for quick use, and the special [bold]suit storage slot[/bold], used only when wearing a space suit, hardsuit or armor, which can store items like oxygen tanks or guns.
  \n[italic]Note: this may slightly vary for nonhumanoid races.[/italic]

  ### Clothing
  The [color=cyan]clothing inventory[/color], opened with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenInventoryMenu"][/bold][/color] or by clicking on the icon, has slots for eyes, head, neck, face, ears, body, external, hands, and shoes.

  To [color=cyan]wear[/color] a piece of clothing, have it in your active hand, then press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] or click on it.
  \nSimilarly, [color=cyan]unequip[/color] items by clicking on them if your active hand is empty.
  You can also equip them by clicking the appropriate slot.

  ### Stacks
  To [color=cyan]halve[/color] a stack of items, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].

  ### Containers
  Open your bag and belt by using [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] on their slots or by clicking the mini-icons in the [bold]bottom right[/bold] of their icons.
  \n[italic]Tip: you can sacrifice your bag to use the back slot for storing guns and other items that would normally fit in the suit storage slot.[/italic]

  ## Interactions
  The game features [bold]six[/bold] main types of context-sensitive interactions, accessible through different methods.

  ### Standard and Alternative
  Clicking [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] performs [color=cyan]standard interactions[/color].
  They heavily depend on the item you're holding and what you click on.

  Some items have [color=cyan]alternative interactions[/color] — use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] to lock lockers, eject sub-items such as batteries from other items, etc.

  ### Activation
  Interact with objects such as containers even when your hands are full by performing [color=cyan]activation interactions[/color] with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].
  This allows you to for example [bold]open containers[/bold] without picking them up, [bold]open doors[/bold] without using the item you're holding, and [bold]reload guns[/bold].

  ### In-hand and alternative in-hand
  Many items also have [bold]use-in-hand interactions[/bold], such as opening bottles, or wielding two-handed guns and big melee weapons with both hands (clubs, spears, axes, mops, shotguns, etc.)
  You may just perform them by using interactions described above, but there are useful hotkeys — [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] for [color=cyan]standard[/color] and [color=cyan]alternative[/color], respectively.

  ### Drag and drop
  The action of using entities you're not holding on other entities, such as "using" mobs (NPCs and players) on objects, incorporates an additional type of interaction: [bold]holding down[/bold] [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] and dragging a mob onto an object.
  (Not to be confused with [italic]pulling[/italic].)
  \nYou can use it to:
  - [color=cyan]Put[/color] a mob on a chair, a bed or a medical scanner.

  - [color=cyan]Climb[/color] yourself onto a table — you can also click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] on the table.

  - Open the [color=cyan]strip menu[/color], allowing you to view another player's equipment — which lets you take it.
  For this one, you would drag another character onto yours, but you can simply use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] on them.

  ### Conclusion
  All the main interactions are: [bolditalic]standard[/bolditalic] (click), [italic]alternative[/italic] (alt+click), [bold]activation[/bold] (use), [bolditalic]use-in-hand[/bolditalic] (click), [italic]alternative use-in-hand[/italic] (alt+click), and drag and drop (which is unique for placing mobs onto objects).
  Don't worry about having to memorize them — they're usually intuitive and consistent across entity categories, and most entities support far fewer than five.

  You can also perform regular interactions with items inside containers.

  ## Menus
  Click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="UIRightClick"/][/bold][/color] on any interactive entity to open the [color=cyan]context menu[/color], which shows you additional interaction you can currently perform, and (sometimes) displays the [bolditalic]Standard Interaction[/bolditalic], [bold]Activation Interaction[/bold], and [italic]Alternative Interaction[/italic], usually formatted like that.
  If you use it on a pile of items, you'll open the [color=cyan]entity menu[/color], listing overlapping entities you can interact with.

  ### Examining
  If you're ever unsure about any entity, whether it's an object or a mob, [color=cyan]examine[/color] it with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ExamineEntity"][/bold][/color].
  You can also examine items in the entity menu.
  This function opens a window displaying the entity's name, a brief description, relevant details, and sometimes a question mark icon that links to the appropriate guidebook section.

  ## Advanced Interactions
  Use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenBackpack"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenBelt"][/bold][/color] to [color=cyan]toggle[/color] your bag and belt inventories, respectively.

  ### Smart-equipping
  Press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipBackpack"][/bold][/color] to [color=cyan]smart-equip[/color] — it quick-stores the item from your active hand into your bag, or if your hand is empty, quick-equips the most recently added item from the bag into your active hand.
  \n[color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipBelt"][/bold][/color] does the same for your belt, making tool access faster.
  \n[italic]Tip: You can also smart-equip single items stored in the bag slot.[/italic]

  ### Organizing inventories
  You can move items [bold]within the same container[/bold] by [color=cyan]dragging[/color] them using [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveStoredItem"][/bold][/color] and [color=cyan]rotate[/color] them with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="RotateStoredItem"][/bold][/color].
  \n[color=cyan]Equip[/color] an item from a container to an empty hand by clicking [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveStoredItem"][/bold][/color] on it.

  It's possible to [color=cyan]save[/color] an item's position in a container with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SaveItemLocation"][/bold][/color], making sure that it always goes back to that saved position when stored.
  If you use this function, that item's saved position will be highlighted in yellow.

  ## Camera
  [color=cyan]Zoom[/color] the camera in and out with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ZoomIn"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ZoomOut"][/bold][/color] and reset with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ResetZoom"][/bold][/color].
  \n[color=cyan]Rotate[/color] it with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraRotateLeft"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraRotateRight"][/bold][/color] and reset with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraReset"][/bold][/color].
  \n[italic]Note: maps are generally designed to be played with default camera rotation.[/italic]
