## Movement
To move your character around, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveUp"][keybind="MoveLeft"][keybind="MoveDown"][keybind="MoveRight"][/bold][/color].

If you run onto slippery objects (like soap or banana peels) or liquids spilt on the ground, your character will [color=cyan]slip[/color] and become momentarily stunned.
Different hazards have different slip thresholds.
If you're moving slower than the threshold, you won't slip.
\nHold [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Walk"][/bold][/color] to move slower and avoid slipping on everything except for [bold]space lube[/bold].
\n[italic]Note: walking can be switched to a [color=cyan]toggle[/color] in the controls menu.[/italic]

Use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="TryPullObject"][/bold][/color] to start [color=cyan]pulling[/color] movable [bold]entities[/bold].
Entities include items, objects, and mobile entities (mobs) such as players.
\nWhile pulling, you can [color=cyan]push[/color] the entity to your cursor with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MovePulledObject"][/bold][/color].
\nTo [color=cyan]let go[/color], press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ReleasePulledObject"][/bold][/color] or pull the same entity again.

If you find yourself in [color=#EB2D3A][bold]zero gravity[/bold][/color], you'll still be able to control your movement as long as you're within reach of any structure.
But if you drift completely off station and into space, you'll need to [bold]throw objects[/bold] or [bold]spray a fire extinguisher[/bold] to propel yourself according to the laws of motion.

## Hands
Your character’s hands are represented by [color=cyan]hand slots[/color], which are centered along the bottom of the screen.
\n[color=cyan]Pick up[/color] items into your active, empty hand with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color].
\n[color=cyan]Swap[/color] between hands with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SwapHands"][/bold][/color] to control which one is active.
\nPay attention to the active hand when using item-related hotkeys — they'll only affect that hand.

Use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Drop"][/bold][/color] to [color=cyan]drop[/color] (or place) an item from your hand within arm's reach.
\n[color=cyan]Throw[/color] it to your cursor with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ThrowItemInHand"][/bold][/color], which has a much greater range than dropping.
\n[italic]Note: you can also use [color=yellow][bolditalic][keybind="Drop"][/bolditalic][/color] to stop pulling entities.[/italic]

## Inventory
Positioned around the hand slots, you’ll find the [color=cyan]inventory bar[/color], which contains all the icons related to your equipment and storage.
It includes the [bold]clothing inventory[/bold] icon in the left corner, followed by slots for your PDA, belt, and the back slot (for bags, guns, etc.).
On the right side, you'll find your pockets, useful for storing items for quick use, and the special [bold]suit storage slot[/bold], used only when wearing a space suit, hardsuit or armor, which can store items like oxygen tanks or guns.
\n[italic]Note: this may slightly vary for nonhumanoid races.[/italic]

The [color=cyan]clothing inventory[/color] (press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenInventoryMenu"][/bold][/color] or click the icon) has slots for eyes, head, neck, face, ears, body, external, hands, and shoes.

If you want to [color=cyan]wear[/color] a piece of equipment: have it in your active hand, then press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] or click on it.
Alternatively, click the appropriate slot.
\n[color=cyan]Unequip[/color] items by clicking a slot.

You [bold]can't[/bold] swap items directly while already holding something. You need an empty hand to take any item.

To quickly access your equipped bag and belt, use the hotkeys [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenBackpack"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenBelt"][/bold][/color], respectively.
Alternatively, open them by using [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] on their slots or by clicking the mini-icons in the [bold]bottom right[/bold] of their icons.
\n[italic]Tip: you can sacrifice your bag to use the back slot for storing guns and other items that would normally fit in the suit slot.[/italic]

[color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipBackpack"][/bold][/color] stores the item from your active hand into your bag, or if your hand is empty, takes the most recently added item from the bag into your hand.
\n[color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipBelt"][/bold][/color] does the same for your belt, making tool access faster.
\n[italic]Tip: if you're using the back slot for storing single items, [color=yellow][bolditalic][keybind="SmartEquipBackpack"][/bolditalic][/color] also allows quick access to them.[/italic]

You can organize grid inventories (containers such as bags and belts) by [color=cyan]dragging[/color] items from one spot to another [bold]within the same container[/bold] by holding [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveStoredItem"][/bold][/color], and [color=cyan]rotate[/color] them on the grid with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="RotateStoredItem"][/bold][/color].
Clicking [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveStoredItem"][/bold][/color] on an item in a container will just [color=cyan]take it out[/color].

To [color=cyan]halve[/color] a stack of items, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].

## Interactions
The game features [bold]five[/bold] main types of context-sensitive interactions, accessible through different methods.

Clicking [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] performs standard interactions.
They heavily depend on the item you're holding and what you click on.

Some items have [color=cyan]alternative interactions[/color] — use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] to lock lockers, eject sub-items from other items, etc.

Interact with objects such as containers even when your hands are full by performing [color=cyan]activation interactions[/color] with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].
This allows you to for example [bold]open containers[/bold] without picking them up, and [bold]open doors[/bold] without using the item you're holding.

You can also perform regular interactions with items stored in an inventory.

Many items also have [color=cyan]standard use-in-hand interactions[/color], such as opening a bottle, reloading a gun or switching to holding an axe with both hands.
\nTo activate or use a held item, press the [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] hotkey (or click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] on it).
\nFor [color=cyan]alternative use-in-hand interactions[/color], use the [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] hotkey (or click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] on it).

In conclusion, all the main interactions are [bolditalic]standard[/bolditalic] (click), [italic]alternative[/italic] (alt+click), [bold]activation[/bold] (use), [bolditalic]use-in-hand[/bolditalic] (click), and [italic]alternative use-in-hand[/italic] (alt+click).
Don't worry about having to memorize them — they're usually intuitive and consistent across entity categories, and most entities support far fewer than five.

## Menus
Click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="UIRightClick"/][/bold][/color] on any interactive entity to open the [color=cyan]context menu[/color], which shows you what you can do with the [bolditalic]Standard Interaction[/bolditalic], [bold]Activation Interaction[/bold], [italic]Alternative Interaction[/italic] (usually formatted like that), and any other possible interactions, all in one list.
If you use it on a pile of items, you'll open the [color=cyan]entity menu[/color], listing the overlapping entities you can interact with.

If you're ever unsure about any entity, whether it's an object or a mob, [color=cyan]examine[/color] it with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ExamineEntity"][/bold][/color].
You can also examine items in the entity menu.
It opens a window displaying the entity's name, a brief description, relevant details, and sometimes a question mark icon that links to the guidebook.

## Drag and drop
The action of "using" mobs incorporates a unique type of interaction: [bold]holding down[/bold] [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] and dragging it.
Not to be confused with [italic]pulling[/italic].

- Drag a mob onto a chair, a bed or objects like the medical scanner to place them onto it.
 
- Drag yourself onto a table to climb it (or use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color]).

- Drag another player onto yourself to open the [bold]strip menu[/bold], allowing you to take their equipment (alternatively, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color]).

## Camera
[color=cyan]Zoom[/color] the camera in and out with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ZoomIn"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ZoomOut"][/bold][/color] and reset with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ResetZoom"][/bold][/color].
\n[color=cyan]Rotate[/color] it with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraRotateLeft"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraRotateRight"][/bold][/color] and reset with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraReset"][/bold][/color].
\n[italic]Note: maps are generally designed to be played with the standard camera rotation.[/italic]
