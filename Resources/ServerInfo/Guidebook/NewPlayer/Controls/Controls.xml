<Box>You can change your keybinds at any time here:</Box>
<Box Orientation="Vertical"><CommandButton Text="ui-options-tab-controls" Command="options 2"/></Box>

## Movement
To move, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveUp"][keybind="MoveLeft"][keybind="MoveDown"][keybind="MoveRight"][/bold][/color].

Slippery objects and surfaces will cause you to lose your footing and become momentarily stunned.
Hold [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Walk"][/bold][/color] to walk slowly and prevent slipping on most of them.
(Note: you can switch walking to a [color=cyan]toggle[/color] in the controls menu.)

You can [color=cyan]pull[/color] entities, including players.
To start pulling, click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="TryPullObject"][/bold][/color] on a movable entity.
While pulling, you can push the entity to your cursor with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MovePulledObject"][/bold][/color].
Press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ReleasePulledObject"][/bold][/color] to let go.

You may find yourself in a situation with [color=#EB2D3A][bold]low gravity[/bold][/color].
You'll be able to control movement direction as long as you're within reach of any structure.
If you end up completely off-station in space, you'll need to [bold]throw objects[/bold] or [bold]spray a fire-extinguisher[/bold] to propel yourself according to the laws of motion.

## Hands
Click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] on holdable items to pick them up with your active hand — make sure it's empty first.
Swap between hands with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SwapHands"][/bold][/color] to control which one is active.
Pay attention to the active hand when using item-related hotkeys — they only affect that hand.

To [color=cyan]drop[/color] an item from your active hand, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Drop"][/bold][/color].
You can also [color=cyan]throw[/color] it to your cursor with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ThrowItemInHand"][/bold][/color].

## Inventory
Your character has an [bold]inventory[/bold] for equipment and clothing.
Toggle your [color=cyan]clothing inventory[/color] with the [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenInventoryMenu"][/bold][/color] hotkey (or by clicking the bottom leftmost icon).
If you want to [color=cyan]wear[/color] a piece of equipment: have it in your active hand, then press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] or click the item, or click the appropriate slot.
De-equip items by clicking on them.

Two of the slots on your hotbar correspond to your [bold]bag and belt[/bold].
If you have a bag or belt equipped, you can quickly access them using the [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenBackpack"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenBelt"][/bold][/color] hotkeys, respectively.
Alternatively, you can open them by using [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] on their hotbar slots or by clicking the mini icon in the [bold]bottom right[/bold] of their icons.

Pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveStoredItem"][/bold][/color] will [color=cyan]take an item out[/color] of an inventory. While holding it down, you can [color=cyan]drag[/color] the item to a different spot in the same container or [color=cyan]rotate[/color] it with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="RotateStoredItem"][/bold][/color].

To halve a stack, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].

[color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipBackpack"][/bold][/color] lets you swap items between your hands and the bag. [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipBelt"][/bold][/color] does the same for your belt, making tool access faster.

## Interactions
Clicking [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] performs standard interactions.
They depend on the item held and what you click on.

Some items have [bold]alternative interactions[/bold], such as locking lockers and ejecting sub-items from other items.
To perform [color=cyan]alternative interactions[/color], use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].

Many items have use-in-hand interactions, such as opening a bottle, reloading a gun or switching to holding an axe with both hands.
To activate or use a held item, press the [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] hotkey or click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] on it.
The alternative counterpart is [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] or [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].

You can interact with objects even when your hands are full.
Perform [color=cyan]activation interactions[/color] by pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].
This allows you to interact with the world without picking items up and without using the items you're holding.
(Note: The alternative counterpart is still [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].)

You can also perform regular interactions with items inside your inventories.

As you see, the game features [bold]three[/bold] main types of context-sensitive interactions accessible through different methods.
You can always click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="UIRightClick"/][/bold][/color] on an interactive entity to open the [color=cyan]context menu[/color].
This menu displays [bold][italic]standard[/italic][/bold], [bold]activation[/bold], [italic]alternative[/italic] (usually formatted like that), and any other possible interactions all in one list.

If you're ever unsure about any entity, whether it's an object or a mob, you can [color=cyan]examine[/color] it by pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ExamineEntity"][/bold][/color].
This opens a window displaying its name, a brief description, relevant details, and sometimes a link to the guidebook seen as an icon with a question mark.

## Drag and drop
"Using" mobs (mobile entities such as players) requires a unique type of interaction:

- Drag a mob onto a chair, a bed or objects like the medical scanner to place them onto it.
 
- Drag yourself onto a table to climb it (also doable with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color]).
  
- Drag another player onto yourself to open the [bold]strip menu[/bold], allowing you to take their equipment.

## Camera
The camera can [color=cyan]zoom[/color] in and out with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ZoomIn"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ZoomOut"][/bold][/color] and can be reset with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ResetZoom"][/bold][/color].
Similarly, you can [color=cyan]rotate[/color] it left and right with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraRotateLeft"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraRotateRight"][/bold][/color] and reset it with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraReset"][/bold][/color].
