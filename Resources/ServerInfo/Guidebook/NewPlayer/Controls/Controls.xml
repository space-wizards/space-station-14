## Movement
To move your character around, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveUp"][keybind="MoveLeft"][keybind="MoveDown"][keybind="MoveRight"][/bold][/color].

If you run onto slippery objects (like soap, banana peels) or liquids spilt on the ground, your character will [color=cyan]slip[/color] and become momentarily stunned.
Different hazards have different slip thresholds.
If you're moving slower than the threshold, you won't slip.
\nHold [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Walk"][/bold][/color] to move slower and avoid slipping — with the exception of [bold]space lube[/bold].
\n[italic]Note: walking can be switched to a [color=cyan]toggle[/color] in the controls menu.[/italic]

Use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="TryPullObject"][/bold][/color] to start [color=cyan]pulling[/color] movable [bold]entities[/bold].
Entities include items, objects, and mobile entities (mobs) such as players.
\nWhile pulling, you can [color=cyan]push[/color] the entity to your cursor with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MovePulledObject"][/bold][/color].
\nTo [color=cyan]let go[/color], press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ReleasePulledObject"][/bold][/color] or pull the same entity again.

If you find yourself in [color=#EB2D3A][bold]zero gravity[/bold][/color], you'll still be able to control your movement as long as you're within reach of any structure.
But if you drift completely off station and into space, you'll need to [bold]throw objects[/bold] or [bold]spray a fire extinguisher[/bold] to propel yourself according to the laws of motion.

## Hands
Your character’s hands are represented by [color=cyan]hand slots[/color], which are centered along the bottom of the screen.
\n[color=cyan]Pick up[/color] holdable items into your active hand with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] — but make sure it's [bold]empty[/bold] first.
\n[color=cyan]Swap[/color] between hands with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SwapHands"][/bold][/color] to control which one is active.
\nPay attention to the active hand when using item-related hotkeys — they'll only affect that hand.

Use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Drop"][/bold][/color] to [color=cyan]drop[/color] (place) an item from your hand within arm's reach.
\n[color=cyan]Throw[/color] it to your cursor with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ThrowItemInHand"][/bold][/color], which has a much greater range than dropping.
\n[italic]Note: you can also use [color=yellow][bolditalic][keybind="Drop"][/bolditalic][/color] to stop pulling entities.[/italic]

## Inventory
Positioned around the hand slots, you’ll find the [color=cyan]inventory bar[/color], which contains all the icons related to your equipment and storage.
It includes the [bold]clothing inventory[/bold] icon in the left corner, then slots for the PDA, belt, and bag, and on the right side you'll find your pockets, and the back/special slot.
\n[italic]Note: this may vary slightly for nonhumanoid races.[/italic]

The [color=cyan]clothing inventory[/color] (press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenInventoryMenu"][/bold][/color] or click on it) has slots for eyes, head, neck, face, ears, body, external, hands, and shoes.

If you want to [color=cyan]wear[/color] a piece of equipment: have it in your active hand, then press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] or click on it.
Alternatively, click the appropriate slot.
[color=cyan]Unequip[/color] items by clicking on them.

You [bold]can't[/bold] swap items directly while already holding something. You need an empty hand to take any item.

To quickly access your equipped bag and belt, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenBackpack"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenBelt"][/bold][/color] hotkeys, respectively.
Alternatively, open them by using [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] on their slots or by clicking the mini-icons in the [bold]bottom right[/bold] of their icons.

[color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipBackpack"][/bold][/color] stores the item from your active hand into your bag, or if your hand is empty, takes the most recently added item from the bag into your hand.
\n[color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipBelt"][/bold][/color] does the same for your belt, making tool access faster.

You can organize grid inventories by [color=cyan]dragging[/color] items from one spot to another [bold]within the same container[/bold] by holding [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveStoredItem"][/bold][/color], and [color=cyan]rotate[/color] them on the grid with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="RotateStoredItem"][/bold][/color].
Clicking [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveStoredItem"][/bold][/color] on an item in a container will just [color=cyan]take it out[/color].

To [color=cyan]halve[/color] a stack of items, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].

## Interactions
The game features [bold]three[/bold] main types of context-sensitive interactions accessible through different methods.

Clicking [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] performs standard interactions.
They depend on the item you're holding and what you click on.

Some items have [color=cyan]alternative interactions[/color].
\nUse [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] to lock lockers, eject sub-items from other items, etc.

Many items have [color=cyan]use-in-hand interactions[/color], such as opening a bottle, reloading a gun or switching to holding an axe with both hands.
\nTo activate or use a held item, press the [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] hotkey (or click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] on it).
\nFor alternative interactions, use the [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] hotkey (or click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] on it).

Interact with objects even when your hands are full by performing [color=cyan]activation interactions[/color] with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].
This allows you to interact with the world without picking items up and without using the items you're holding.
\n[italic]Note: the alternative counterpart is still [color=yellow][bolditalic][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bolditalic][/color].[/italic]

You can also perform regular interactions with items stored in an inventory.

## Menus
Click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="UIRightClick"/][/bold][/color] on any interactive entity to open the [color=cyan]context menu[/color], which displays the [bolditalic]Standard Interaction[/bolditalic], [bold]Activation Interaction[/bold], [italic]Alternative Interaction[/italic] (usually formatted like that), and any other possible interactions, all in one list.
If you use it on a pile of items, you'll open the [color=cyan]entity menu[/color], listing the overlapping entities you can interact with.

If you're ever unsure about any entity, whether it's an object or a mob, [color=cyan]examine[/color] it with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ExamineEntity"][/bold][/color].
You can also do that while browsing a list of entities ([color=yellow][bold][keybind="UIRightClick"/][/bold][/color]).
It opens a window displaying the entity's name, a brief description, relevant details, and sometimes a link to the guidebook that looks like a circle with a question mark.

## Drag and drop
The action of "using" mobs incorporates a unique type of interaction: [bold]holding down[/bold] [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] and dragging it.
Not to be confused with [italic]pulling[/italic].

- Drag a mob onto a chair, a bed or objects like the medical scanner to place them onto it.
 
- Drag yourself onto a table to climb it (or use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color]).

- Drag another player onto yourself to open the [bold]strip menu[/bold], allowing you to take their equipment (alternatively, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color]).

## Camera
[color=cyan]Zoom[/color] the camera in and out with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ZoomIn"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ZoomOut"][/bold][/color] and reset with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ResetZoom"][/bold][/color].
\n[color=cyan]Rotate[/color] it with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraRotateLeft"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraRotateRight"][/bold][/color] and reset with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraReset"][/bold][/color].
\n[italic]Note: maps are generally designed to be played with the standard camera rotation.[/italic]
