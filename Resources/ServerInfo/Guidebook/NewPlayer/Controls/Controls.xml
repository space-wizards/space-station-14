  ## Movement
  To move your character around, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveUp"][keybind="MoveLeft"][keybind="MoveDown"][keybind="MoveRight"][/bold][/color].

  Movement speed is affected by carried objects and afflictions, but you can also hold [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Walk"][/bold][/color] to [color=cyan]walk[/color] slower.
  This helps you avoid [color=cyan]slipping[/color] and falling over when walking over hazards.
  \n[italic]Note: walking can be switched to a [bolditalic]toggle[/bolditalic] in the controls menu.[/italic]

  If you find yourself in [color=#EB2D3A]zero gravity[/color], you'll still be able to control your movement as long as you're within reach of any structure.
  But if you drift completely off station and into [color=#EB2D3A][bold]space[/bold][/color], you'll need to [bold]throw objects[/bold] in the opposite direction or [bold]spray a fire extinguisher[/bold] to propel yourself.

  ## Pulling
  Use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="TryPullObject"][/bold][/color] to start [color=cyan]pulling[/color] movable [bold]entities[/bold] — items, objects, and mobs such as players.
  \nWhile pulling an entity, you can [color=cyan]push[/color] it to your cursor with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MovePulledObject"][/bold][/color].
  This will prove useful for objects that are too heavy to carry.
  \nTo [color=cyan]release[/color], press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ReleasePulledObject"][/bold][/color] or pull the same entity again.

  ## Hands
  Your character’s hands are represented by [bold]hand slots[/bold], which are centered along the bottom of the screen.
  One of your hands is always the [color=cyan]active hand[/color].
  \n[color=cyan]Take[/color] items into your active, empty hand with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color].
  \n[color=cyan]Swap[/color] between hands with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SwapHands"][/bold][/color] to control which one is active.
  \n[italic]Tip: pay attention to your active hand when interacting with the world to prevent accidents.[/italic]

  Use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Drop"][/bold][/color] to [color=cyan]drop[/color] (or place) an item from your hand within arm's reach.
  \n[color=cyan]Throw[/color] items to your cursor with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ThrowItemInHand"][/bold][/color].
  \n[italic]Note: you can also use [color=yellow][keybind="Drop"][/color] to release pulled entities.[/italic]

  ## Inventory
  Positioned around the hand slots, you’ll find the [color=cyan]inventory bar[/color], which contains all the icons related to your equipment and storage.
  It includes the [bold]clothing inventory[/bold] icon in the left corner, followed by slots for your [bold]PDA[/bold], [bold]belt[/bold], and the [bold]back[/bold] slot (for bags, guns, etc.)
  On the right side, you'll find your [bold]pockets[/bold], useful for storing items for quick use, and the special [bold]suit storage slot[/bold], used only when wearing a space suit, hardsuit or armor, which can store items like oxygen tanks or guns.
  \n[italic]Note: this may slightly vary for nonhumanoid races.[/italic]

  The [color=cyan]clothing inventory[/color], opened with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenInventoryMenu"][/bold][/color] or by clicking on the icon, has slots for eyes, head, neck, face, ears, body, external, hands, and shoes.

  To [color=cyan]wear[/color] a piece of clothing, have it in your active hand, then press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] or click on it.
  \nSimilarly, [color=cyan]unequip[/color] items by clicking on them, and equip by clicking the appropriate slot.

    To [color=cyan]halve[/color] a stack of items, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].

  ## Interactions
  The game features [bold]five[/bold] main types of context-sensitive interactions, accessible through different methods.

  Clicking [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] performs standard interactions.
  They heavily depend on the item you're holding and what you click on.

  Some items have [color=cyan]alternative interactions[/color] — use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] to lock lockers, eject sub-items such as batteries from other items, etc.

  Interact with objects such as containers even when your hands are full by performing [color=cyan]activation interactions[/color] with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color].
  This allows you to for example [bold]open containers[/bold] without picking them up, [bold]open doors[/bold] without using the item you're holding, and [bold]reload guns[/bold].

  You can also perform regular interactions with items stored in an inventory.

  Many items also have [color=cyan]standard use-in-hand interactions[/color], such as opening bottles, or wielding two-handed guns and big melee weapons with both hands (clubs, spears, axes, mops, shotguns, etc.)
  \nTo activate or use a held item, press the [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] hotkey (or click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] on it).
  \nFor [color=cyan]alternative use-in-hand interactions[/color], use the [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInHand"][/bold][/color] hotkey (or click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] on it).

  In conclusion, all the main interactions are: [bolditalic]standard[/bolditalic] (click), [italic]alternative[/italic] (alt+click), [bold]activation[/bold] (use), [bolditalic]use-in-hand[/bolditalic] (click), and [italic]alternative use-in-hand[/italic] (alt+click).
  Don't worry about having to memorize them — they're usually intuitive and consistent across entity categories, and most entities support far fewer than five.

  ## Advanced Interactions
  Open your bag and belt by using [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] on their slots or by clicking the mini-icons in the [bold]bottom right[/bold] of their icons.
  To access them quickly, use the hotkeys [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenBackpack"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenBelt"][/bold][/color], respectively.
  \n[italic]Tip: you can sacrifice your bag to use the back slot for storing guns and other items that would normally fit in the suit storage slot.[/italic]

  [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipBackpack"][/bold][/color] quick-swaps items: it stores the item from your active hand into your bag, or if your hand is empty, takes the most recently added item from the bag into your hand.
  \n[color=yellow][bold][keybind="SmartEquipBelt"][/bold][/color] does the same for your belt, making tool access faster.
  \n[italic]Tip: if you're using the back slot for storing a single item, [color=yellow][bolditalic][keybind="SmartEquipBackpack"][/bolditalic][/color] also allows quick access to it.[/italic]

  Clicking [color=yellow][bold][keybind="SaveItemLocation"][/bold][/color] saves an item's position in a container, making sure that it always goes back to that saved position when stored.

  You can organize grid inventories (containers such as bags and belts) by [color=cyan]dragging[/color] items from one spot to another [bold]within the same container[/bold] by holding [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveStoredItem"][/bold][/color], and [color=cyan]rotate[/color] them on the grid with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="RotateStoredItem"][/bold][/color].
  Clicking [color=yellow][bold][keybind="MoveStoredItem"][/bold][/color] on an item in a container will just [color=cyan]take it out[/color].

  ## Menus
  Click [color=yellow][bold][keybind="UIRightClick"/][/bold][/color] on any interactive entity to open the [color=cyan]context menu[/color], which (most of time time) shows you every possible interaction you can currently perform, including the [bolditalic]Standard Interaction[/bolditalic], [bold]Activation Interaction[/bold], and [italic]Alternative Interaction[/italic], usually formatted like that.
  If you use it on a pile of items, you'll open the [color=cyan]entity menu[/color], listing the overlapping entities you can interact with.

  If you're ever unsure about any entity, whether it's an object or a mob, [color=cyan]examine[/color] it with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ExamineEntity"][/bold][/color].
  You can also examine items in the entity menu.
  This action opens a window displaying the entity's name, a brief description, relevant details, and sometimes a question mark icon that links to the guidebook.

  ## Drag and drop
  The action of "using" mobs on entities incorporates a unique type of interaction: [bold]holding down[/bold] [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] and dragging a mob onto an object.
  (Not to be confused with [italic]pulling[/italic].)

  - Drag a mob onto a chair, a bed or objects like the medical scanner to place them onto it.

  - Drag yourself onto a table to climb it (or use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="AltActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color] on it).

  - Drag another player onto yourself to open the [bold]strip menu[/bold], allowing you to view their equipment and optionally try to steal it (alternatively, use [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld"][/bold][/color]).

  For more details about controls, please refer to the [color=cyan]Wiki[/color].

  ## Camera
  [color=cyan]Zoom[/color] the camera in and out with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ZoomIn"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ZoomOut"][/bold][/color] and reset with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ResetZoom"][/bold][/color].
  \n[color=cyan]Rotate[/color] it with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraRotateLeft"][/bold][/color] and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraRotateRight"][/bold][/color] and reset with [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CameraReset"][/bold][/color].
  \n[italic]Note: maps are generally designed to be played with default camera rotation.[/italic]
