# Speech and Text Channels
Talking is a key part of Space Station 14. You can press [color=yellow][bold][keybind="FocusChatInputWindow"/][/bold][/color] to jump to the text box.

The word next to the text box is the [color=#a4885c]text channel[/color] you're about to send the message to, or rather how you're about to say what you've typed.

[bold]Local[/bold] is normal speech at normal volume.

[bold]Whisper[/bold] can only be heard when nearby somebody. You automatically whisper into your radio to send messages over it.

[bold]Emotes[/bold] are gestures that you make. Can be recieved by anyone who is not blinded. You will often see mimes do many emotes.

Whisper messages can be sent by starting your message with "[color=#a4885c][keybind="FocusWhisperChatWindow"/][/color]" and Emotes can be sent by starting your message with "[color=#a4885c]@[/color]".
You can also cycle through all of these text channels by pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="CycleChatChannelForward"/][/bold][/color].

People may not be able to make out all of what you're saying if you're standing too far away from them. This is especially important if you're whispering.

## Radio

Your radio allows you to communicate across the entire station and to your specific [color=#a4885c]department[/color].

To send a [color=#a4885c]station-wide[/color] message over the radio preface, use the [color=#32cd32][bold]Common[/bold][/color] channel by beginning your text with [color=#32cd32]semi-colon (;)[/color].
People standing right next to you might catch bits of your radio message, even if they don't have the access to the relevant radio channel. Watch for eavesdroppers.

## Departmental Radio

You are able to send messages over your departmental radio channels using [color=#32cd32]colon (:)[/color] followed by the department letter as long as you're wearing a headset with your department's encryption key.

Examine your headset to see the department channels available to you.

Examining an unmodified engineering headset would show you the prefixes for the [color=#32cd32]Common[/color] and [color=#f37746]Engineering[/color] channels.

It is also possible to use [color=#a4885c]:h[/color]. This hotkey will automatically default to your department radio channel.
For example, if you're a Station Engineer then [color=#a4885c]:h[/color] will default to [color=#f37746]:e[/color].

## Encryption Keys
[color=#a4885c]Encryption keys[/color] give you access to their respective channel.

Examining our engineering headset from earlier shows us [color=#32cd32]Common[/color] and [color=#f37746]Engineering[/color] because an engineer's headset starts with those [color=#a4885c]encryption keys[/color].

You can take out encryption keys by using a [color=#a4885c]screwdriver[/color] on a headset. New encryption keys are put into headsets by clicking on one with an encryption key in your hand.

All command members have extras of their relevant encryption key, but you can also request one at the HoP's office when you're getting your job changed.

## OOC Channels
OOC (out-of-character) channels exist outside of the game world; in them you are not speaking as your character, but as yourself! They are the Help, Dead and OOC chat.

[bold]Help[/bold] chat lets you ask other players near you questions about the game. It has the same range as Local chat and can be used even if your character couldn't normally speak.

[bold]Dead[/bold] chat is the main chat you use when you're dead. It's global and can be heard across the game, but only by other dead players.

[bold]OOC[/bold] is the main global chat heard by every player, and is therefore typically off until the round ends.

Do not discuss the current round in the Discord or in OOC if it's on during the round.
