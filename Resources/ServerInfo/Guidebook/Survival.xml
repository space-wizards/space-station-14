# Survival
The life of a single person may make or break a situation if [color=#5b97bc]Medical[/color] is already swamped and under pressure.

Your [color=cyan]longevity[/color] is vital to the station when [textlink="evil-doers" link="Antagonists"] rise up against the crew.

## Being Prepared
The PDA you start with can tell you the [bold]station you are on[/bold], [bold]every member of the crew[/bold] and the [textlink="alert level." link="AlertLevels"]

Beyond that, one of the best things you can do is turn on your [color=cyan]suit sensors[/color], done by opening up your suit's context menu (done by pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="UIRightClick"/][/bold][/color]) and navigating to "Sensor" then "Coordinates".
This gives [color=#5b97bc]Medical[/color] a huge advantage towards finding you should you be mortally wounded.

You should also take a look inside your [color=cyan]survival box[/color], which starts inside of your bag. It contains:
- An [bold]emergency oxygen tank[/bold] as well as a [bold]breath mask[/bold]
- Emergency [bold]food and water[/bold]
- An [bold]emergency flare[/bold]
- An [bold]emergency medipen[/bold], which contains a live-saving dose of epinephrine

## Emergency Treatment 
In the event of a medical emergency, there are a few things you can do to help ensure your long-term survival, including:
- Using [bold]detailed examine[/bold] to see obvious wounds on yourself or others.
- Using [bold]emergency medipens[/bold] on people who are in or are about to enter critical condition.

- Eating [bold]carrots[/bold], if available, to heal blindness.
- Eating [bold]nutritious handmade meals[/bold] to help with minor wounds and overall health.
