    # What is an SOP?

    This SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) provides general guidelines for the station crew during your shift. These guidelines may be changed by the station's Captain at any time. This SOP is considered a general form of conduct for all crew members.

    # How do I use an SOP?
    This should not be a considered a checklist of conditions to fire someone over, and should not be rigidly followed to the letter in detriment of circumstances and context. SOPs can be malleable if the situation requires, and the decision to punish personnel for breaching it ultimately falls onto the relevant Head of Staff, for Department Members, or Captain, for the Head of Staff.

    # How does this SOP help me?
    This SOP gives you a code of conduct to abide by. You should follow what is in the following document, and repeated violations may result in contract termination, or removal from this sector.

    This SOP gives power to command to help determine what their department workers should be doing. It will help you guide the prospective hiring and firing of crew members.

    Similarly, the SOP gives power to the crew, by allowing you to depose and fire relevant command members, as long as the reason is valid.

    Central Command should be contacted for any questions regarding this SOP.
