  Space dragons are giant extradimensional fish that can [color=red]eat crew[/color] and create [color=#4b7fcc]carp rifts.[/color]
  - Dragons have powerful jaws that allow them to [color=red][italic]Devour[/italic][/color] infrastructure such as doors, windows, and walls.
  - They can also heal themselves by using [color=red][italic]Devour[/italic][/color] on crew members that have gone unconscious or have died.
  - Your [color=orange][italic]Dragon's Breath[/italic][/color] is a [bold]flaming projectile[/bold] which travels a straight flight path, exploding multiple times and igniting things along the way. Try not to hit your carps with this!
  - You have the ability to [color=#4b7fcc][italic]Summon a Carp Rift[/italic][/color]. Rifts periodically spawn [bold]space carp[/bold] and charge up energy over a period of 5 minutes, [bold]which is when it's vulnerable.[/bold] After 5 minutes, it becomes invulnerable and will continue summoning carp as long as the dragon lives.
  - You'll suffer a [bold]temporary debilitating feedback effect[/bold] if one of your rifts are destroyed before it's done charging.
  - If a period of five minutes passes since your spawn or since the last time a rift was charging, [bold]you'll disappear.[/bold]
  - Dragons who have the maximum of 3 fully charged rifts will [bold]never disappear[/bold], but they are still mortal.

  - Slimes may [bold]deal extra cellular or poison damage[/bold], based upon their color. Water hurts them just as it would hurt a slime person.
  - Spiders have a venomous bite and can [bold]create webs[/bold] that are hard to move though. Webs are easily destroyed with a blade. They can also pry open airlocks.
