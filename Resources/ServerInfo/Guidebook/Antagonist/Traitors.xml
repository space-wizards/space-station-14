  Traitors are antagonists employed by the [color=#ff0000]Syndicate.[/color] You are a sleeper agent who has access to various tools and weapons through your [bold]uplink[/bold].
  You also receive [bold]codewords[/bold] to identify other agents, and a coordinated team of traitors can have [italic]brutal results.[/italic]

  Anyone besides [textlink="department heads" link="Command"] or members of [textlink="Security" link="Security"] can be a traitor.

  ## Uplink & Activation
  The [color=cyan]uplink[/color] is your most important tool as a traitor. You can exchange the 20 [color=red]telecrystals[/color] (TC) you start with for items that will help you with your objectives.

  By pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenCharacterMenu"][/bold][/color], you'll see your personal uplink code. [bold]Setting your PDA's ringtone as this code will open the uplink.[/bold]
  Pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenCharacterMenu"][/bold][/color] also lets you view your objectives and the codewords.

  If you do not have a PDA when you are activated, an [color=cyan]uplink implant[/color] is provided [bold]for the full [color=red]TC[/color] price of the implant.[/bold]
  It can be accessed from your hotbar.

  [bold]Make sure to close your PDA uplink to prevent anyone else from seeing it.[/bold] You don't want [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] to get their hands on this premium selection of contraband!

  Implanted uplinks are not normally accessible to other people, so they do not have any security measures. They can, however, be removed from you with an empty implanter.

  The purchases that you make should be to help you with your objectives. Some gear may not be of use to you, and you'll have to choose between being sneaky or going loud.

  ## Coordination
  Codewords are words or phrases that every traitor will know. They provide a discreet way to identify or establish contact with a fellow traitor, which can be useful if your objectives include [italic][color=cyan]keeping them alive[/color][/italic] or [italic][color=cyan]helping them with their objectives.[/color][/italic]

  When you find some friends, [bold]you can withdraw [color=red]telecrystals[/color] from your uplink to give to them.[/bold] They can put these in their own uplink to spend for themselves.

  Some offers available on your uplink require more than 20 TC to purchase, so if you want them you'll have to share.

  ## Assassination
  One of your objectives may be to [italic][color=cyan]kill or maroon a crewmember.[/color][/italic]

  You can [color=cyan]maroon[/color] your target by [bold]preventing them from reaching CentComm[/bold] via the evacuation shuttle or an escape pod.

  If you can't maroon your target or they're too important to leave alive, you'll have to get your hands dirty and [color=cyan]murder[/color] them. Make sure your target is not alive when the [bold]evacuation shuttle gets to CentComm,[/bold] and don't let them be resuscitated.

  Remember, the Syndicate want only your targets dead. [color=red]Try to avoid mass murder or major damage to the station,[/color] as the more innocent lives you take, the more of a liability you become.

  ## Evasion & Self-Termination
  Your objectives may require you to [italic][color=cyan]make it to CentComm without being killed or captured.[/color][/italic] Don't let [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] stop you, complete your other objectives and [bold]come back alive.[/bold]

  Alternatively, your objectives may require you to [italic][color=cyan]die a glorious death.[/color][/italic] [bold]Make sure you don't come back from the dead,[/bold] or else you may wake up in cuffs.

  ## Appropiation
  More often than not, you'll have to [italic][color=cyan]steal a possession of a department head.[/color][/italic]

  The target may be in their office, or on their person. It may become necessary to kill whoever is carrying it, if you cannot pickpocket them.

  You may be tasked with:
  - Stealing the [color=yellow]Captain[/color]'s [bold]ID Card[/bold], [bold]antique laser pistol[/bold], [bold]jetpack[/bold], or [bold]nuclear authentication disk[/bold].
