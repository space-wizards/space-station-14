  Revolutionaries are [bold]conversion antagonists[/bold] sponsored by the [color=#ff0000]Syndicate[/color].
  They have no secret weapons, no hidden tricks-only [italic]a cause[/italic] and [bold]strength in numbers[/bold].
  Your purpose is not to destroy the station, but to [italic]seize control of it[/italic].

  ## Objectives
  Your main goal is to [color=cyan]convert[/color], [color=yellow]cuff[/color], or [color=red]kill[/color] all of the [textlink="Command staff" link="Command"] and [color=#cb0000]Security[/color].
  These roles form the backbone of station authority, and they are always protected by [color=cyan]mindshield implants[/color].

  [bold]Converting command and/or security is critical for success.[/bold]
  Converted command/security can play key roles in empowering your revolution.

  The revolution also fails if all [bold][color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionaries[/color][/bold] are killed.
  In that case, every [color=red]Revolutionary[/color] deconverts immediately.

  ## Head Revolutionaries
  At the start of the shift, several crew are chosen as [bold][color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionaries[/color][/bold].
  They begin with a [color=cyan]flash[/color] and a pair of [color=cyan]sunglasses[/color].

  ### Conversion
  - To convert, hit someone with a [bold]flash[/bold] on [color=red]harm mode[/color].
  - [bold]Conversion fails if the target either has [color=cyan]flash protection[/color][/bold] (such as sunglasses, security glasses, or welding masks) [bold]or a [color=cyan]mindshield implant[/color].[/bold]

  ## Regular Revolutionaries
  A [color=red]Revolutionary[/color] (indicated by a red R) is a crewmember converted by a [color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionary[/color] (indicated by a blue R).
  They [bold]cannot convert others[/bold] themselves, but their loyalty and numbers are the lifeblood of the movement.

  [bold][color=red]Revolutionaries[/color] are expected to follow the orders of the Head Revolutionaries.[/bold]
  Acting independently weakens the cause, teamwork and coordination win revolutions.
  Whether it’s subduing command and security, protecting a Headrev, or gathering resources, your strength comes from working together.

  ## Mindshield Implants

  [color=cyan]Mindshield implants[/color] are your greatest obstacle. They will:
  - Prevent conversion into a [color=red]Revolutionary[/color]
  - Deconvert existing revolutionaries
  - [bold]Visibly be destroyed upon being implanted into a [color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionary[/color][/bold], giving you away
  - NOT protect against flash disorientation

  Assume all of [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] and [color=#1b67a5]Command[/color] are implanted with mindshields already, [bold]however they can be removed using an implant extractor, obtainable from the Medical department's MedFab.[/bold]

  ### How to Remove Mindshields
  1. Craft an [color=cyan]implant extractor[/color] at a [bold]Medical TechFab[/bold] (5 steel, 5 glass).

  2. Subdue your target (stun, cuff, or otherwise restrain them).

  3. Use the extractor to remove their implant [italic](ensure the implanter is set to extract mindshields).[/italic]

  4. Take away any flash protection they have.

  5. Flash them in [color=red]harm mode[/color] to convert.

  [color=red][bold]Beware:[/bold][/color] Removing mindshields is risky, those with the security hud are able to see who is and isn't mindshielded. If Security notices a command or security member without a mindshield, it will instantly out them as being a revolutionary.

  ### Tips for Converting Command/Security
  - [bold]Coordinate[/bold] ambushes with other revolutionaries.
  - [bold]Involve[/bold] converted medical staff to produce implant extractors.
  - If conversion isn’t possible, [bold]restraining[/bold] or [bold]eliminating[/bold] the target is a last resort.
