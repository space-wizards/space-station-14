  # Antagonists

  Antagonists are the driving force of every shift, usually creating conflict and defying the crew. Their goals can vary a lot, but they usually require some thievery, sabotage, or murder.

  ## Various Antagonists

  Antagonists can take many forms, including:
  - Nuclear operatives, with the goal of infiltrating and destroying the station by arming the Nuke.
  - Traitors infiltrating the crew, who can assassinate targets and steal high value items.
  - Revolutionaries, who want all the heads of staff dead and the crew converted to their side.
  - A space ninja, who can steal all of R&D's technologies and call [italics]more[/italics] antagonists to the station.
  - Several non-humanoid creatures, who usually just try to bring down as many crewmembers as they can.
