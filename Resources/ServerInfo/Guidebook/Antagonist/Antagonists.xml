  # Antagonists

  Antagonists are the driving force of every shift, usually creating conflict and defying the crew. Their goals can vary a lot, but they usually require some thievery, sabotage, or murder.

  ## Various Antagonists

  Antagonists can take many forms, like:
  - Nuclear operatives, with the goal of infiltrating and destroying the station.
  - Traitors infiltrating the crew who can assassinate targets and steal high value items.
  - Space Ninjas, masters of espionage and sabotage, who are equipped with special gear.
  - Several non-humanoid creatures, who usually just try to bring down as many crewmembers as they can.
