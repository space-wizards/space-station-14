  You've just been chosen to be a nuclear operative for the [color=#ff0000]Syndicate[/color]. You have one goal, to blow up one of Nanotrasen's finest vessels with a nuclear fission explosive.

  ## Operatives
  Your team will be made up of several different roles, which are:
  - [bold]Operatives[/bold], standard soldiers who can take up the grunt work.
  - The [bold]Agent[/bold] who works with reagents to make medicines or chemical weapons.
  - The [bold]Commander[/bold] who draws up the plan and leads the team.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingOuterHardsuitSyndieCommander" Caption="commander's hardsuit"/>
  </Box>

  If you have been selected as the Agent or Commander but don't feel ready, one of your teammates can take responsibility.

  ## The Disk

  Each operative starts with a [color=cyan]pinpointer[/color], which you should turn on and keep with you at all times. It will always point to the [color=cyan]nuclear authentication disk.[/color]
  The disk belongs to the [color=yellow]Captain[/color], who will almost always have it on them. Follow the direction of the arrow on the pinpointer to the disk, and [italic]do whatever it takes to get it[/italic].

  ## Preparation
  Each member in your squad has been given an [color=cyan]uplink[/color] to purchase everything you will need for the mission, similar to [textlink="traitors." link="Traitors"]

  You can purchase the same kinds of gear traitors can, but you have higher quality gear available to you and more telecrystals to spend.

  You'll also have to choose if you want to [color=red]declare war[/color] or not. Doing so grants your team [bold]40 extra telecrystals each[/bold].
  However, the crew will immediately know of your existence and will have plenty of time to prepare for your arrival.

  The [bold]Commander[/bold] is the only person who can declare war. Make your choice quick, [italic]this is a limited-time offer![/italic]

  ## Getting to the Station
  You've got the plan, you've got the gear. Now, execute.

  Grab a [bold]jetpack[/bold] from your armory and go with your other operatives to your [color=cyan]shuttle[/color].
  Among other things you may need, you'll find an [bold]IFF Computer[/bold] on the shuttle. It allows you to hide from other ships and mass scanners when [italic]Show IFF[/italic] and [italic]Show Vessel[/italic] are toggled off.

  When everyone is ready, FTL to the station and fly to it with a jetpack. Don't forget the code, your pinpointers and the nuke if you're taking it.

  ## The Nuke & Arming Procedure
  You have a paper with the [color=cyan]nuclear authentication codes[/color] on your shuttle. [bold]Check to see if the nuke ID matches the one on your shuttle.[/bold] If it doesn't, you'll be arming the station's nuke instead.

  - Obtain the [bold]nuclear authentication disk[/bold] and insert it into the nuke.
  - Type in the [bold]nuclear authentication code[/bold] and press "[bold]E[/bold]" on the keypad to Enter.
  - [bold]To begin the self-destruct sequence, press [color=#EB2D3A]ARM[/color][/bold]. After 300 seconds, the nuke will explode.
  - [bold]Defend the nuke[/bold], even if it's at the cost of your lives! The mission requirements do not include your return.
  - It takes 30 seconds for someone to [bold]disarm[/bold] the nuke. Re-arming it is possible, but the chance of mission success drops if you let it happen.
  - Should the nuke be re-armed, the timer will start from where it left off.
