  # Nuclear Operatives
  [color=#999999][italic]"OPERATIVES STANDBY. YOUR OBJECTIVES ARE SIMPLE. DELIVER THE PAYLOAD AND GET OUT BEFORE THE PAYLOAD DETONATES. BEGIN MISSION."[/italic][/color]

  You've just been chosen to be a nuclear operative for the Syndicate. You have one goal, to blow up one of Nanotrasen's finest vessels with a nuclear fission explosive.

  ## Operatives
  Your team will be made up of several different roles, which are:
  - [bold]Operatives[/bold], standard soldiers who can take up the grunt work.
  - [bold]Agents[/bold], combat medics who will keep your team in the fight.
  - The [bold]Commander[/bold] who draws up the plan and leads the team.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingOuterHardsuitSyndieCommander" Caption="commander's hardsuit"/>
  </Box>

  If you have been selected for either of these special roles but don't feel ready, one of your teammates can take responsibility.

  ## The Disk

  Each operative starts with a [color=cyan]pinpointer[/color], which you should turn on and keep with you at all times. It will always point to the [color=cyan]nuclear authentication disk.[/color]
  The disk belongs to the captain, who will almost always have it on them. Follow the direction of the arrow on the pinpointer to the disk, and [bold]do whatever it takes to get it[/bold].

  ## Preparation
  Each member in your squad has been given an [color=cyan]uplink[/color] to purchase everything you will need for the mission, similar to [textlink="Traitors." link="Traitors"]

  You can purchase the same kinds of gear Traitors can, but you have more quality gear than in a Traitor uplink and more telecrystals to spend.

  ## Getting to the Station
  You've got the plan, you've got the gear. Now, execute.

  Grab a [bold]jetpack[/bold] from your armory and go with your other operatives to the [color=cyan]Syndicate Shuttle[/color].
  Among other things, you'll find an [color=cyan]IFF Console[/color] on the shuttle. it allows you to hide from other ships and mass scanners when "[bold]Show IFF[/bold]" and "[bold]Show Vessel[/bold]" are toggled off.
  
  When everyone is ready, FTL to the station and fly to it with a jetpack. Don't forget your codes, your pinpointers and the nuke if you're taking it.

  ## The Nuke & Arming Procedure
  You have a paper with the [color=cyan]nuke codes[/color] on your shuttle. Check to see if the nuke ID matches the one on your shuttle. If it doesn't, you'll have to use explosive in the station's vault.

  - Obtain the [bold]nuclear authentication disk[/bold] and insert it into the nuke.
  - Type in the [bold]nuclear authentication code[/bold] and press "E" to Enter.
  - The [bold]self-destruct process[/bold] will begin. After 300 seconds, the nuke will explode.
  - [bold]Defend the nuke[/bold], even if it's at the cost of your lives! The mission requirements do not include your return. Do what it takes to keep the crew from disarming the nuke.
  - It takes 30 seconds for someone to [bold]disarm[/bold] the nuke. Re-arming it is unlikely.
