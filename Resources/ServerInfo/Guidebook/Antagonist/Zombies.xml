  - Zombies are an antagonist that infect most-all beings that they bite.

  ## Infection

  - The three ways of getting infected are: starting out as the Intial Infected (or II) and turning into a zombie through the related action, being bitten by a zombified being, or being injected with a minimum of 5 units of [color=#a4885c]Romerol[/color] (obtainable through a Nuclear Operatives uplink radio).

  ## Objectives

  - The main objective of a zombie is to infect the entire station's crew and to not die again to the crew or to a CBURN team.

  ## Cure

  - If you are already zombified, the only cure, unfortunately, is death.
  - If you are not zombified yet, taking in 5 units of [color=#a4885c]Ambuzol[/color] will stop the infection from ensuing your timely demise, but you may still get reinfected if you're not too careful.
  - Taking in 5 units of [color=#a4885c]Ambuzol Plus[/color] will both stop an ongoing infection and vaccinate yourself from future infections, but only while you are alive.
