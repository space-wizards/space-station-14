  Wizards are a force of chaos and unpredictability. You never know what one is going to do next.
  Generally sent by the [color=#40E0D0]Space Wizards Federation[/color] or some schmuck turned into one by rolling a nat 20 on a cursed die.
  And since a Wizard is highly unpredictable, one may show up when you least expect it!

  ## The Grimoire

  [bold]By wizard law of eld your Grimoire is bound to you.[/bold] This means you cannot share your Grimoire with anyone else. The spells and equipment inside are for you and you alone.
  The Wizard's Grimoire is used to get all sorts of magical spells, equipment, and creatures. What's available to you is [italic]extremely powerful[/italic] so you only have 10 [color=#FF0000]W[/color][color=#FFA500]i[/color][color=#FFFF00]z[/color][color=#00FF00]€[/color][color=#0000FF]o[/color][color=#4B0082]i[/color][color=#8F00FF]n[/color]™ to spend on them.
  Your only limit, other than the price, is your creativity. Try to find some combinations!

  If you ever find yourself wanting to ponder, look no further! The [bold]Pondering Orb[/bold] allows the Wizard to tap into the Station's camera network to spy on others unsuspectingly.
  Could be useful if you're trying to plan something out or stay one step ahead of [color=red]Security[/color].
