## Character Records

You can create records for you characters in the records tab of the character
creator. Just simply fill in the values and save. Entries should typically be
written from the perspective of a CentCom official.

## Employment Entries

Employment Entries should include your characters education, previous jobs, and
anything that you think NanoTrasen would log about your characters past that is
not security related.

## Medical Entries

Medical Entries should include anything a doctor should know before treating
your character, major surgeries, prescriptions, and any psychological evaluations.

## Security Entries

Security Entries should include any major arrests/incidents your character has
had in their past or while working with NanoTrasen. Do not log minor incidents.

## Accessing Records
You can access the records of your crewmates in game from their respective consoles.

It is currently not possible to create new records in game. This is something
that will be added in the future. If there is something that occurs in the round
that you think is relevant for a record entry, it is on you to write it at the
moment. Keep in mind that records should typically be written from the
perspective of some CentCom official.
