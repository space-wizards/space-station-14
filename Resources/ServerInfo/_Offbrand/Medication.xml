# Medication

The [color=#5b97bc]Medical[/color] department can make use of various medications to stabilize, treat, or provide comfort to patients.

## Stabilizing Medications

These medicines primarily slow down how fast a patient's condition worsens, without treating their underlying causes.

<GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="Dexalin"/>
<GuideReagentEmbed Reagent="DexalinPlus"/>

## Painkillers

These medicines reduce how much pain a patient feels, reducing the risk of pain shock and allowing them better use of their body.

They do not treat the underlying causes of pain, and allowing them to wear off before a patient's injuries have been treated can lead to cardiac arrest.
