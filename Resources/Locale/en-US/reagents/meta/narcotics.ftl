reagent-name-desoxyephedrine = desoxyephedrine
reagent-desc-desoxyephedrine = A more effective ephedrine, with more active downsides. Requires less doses to cure narcolepsy.

reagent-name-ephedrine = ephedrine
reagent-desc-ephedrine = A caffeinated adrenaline stimulator chemical that makes you faster and harder to knock down. Also helps combat narcolepsy at dosages over thirty, at the cost of severe nerval stress.

reagent-name-stimulants = stimulants
reagent-desc-stimulants = A chemical cocktail developed by Donk Co. that allows agents to recover from stuns faster, move more quickly, and grants a small heal while close to critical condition. Due to the complex nature of the chemical, it is much harder for the body to purge naturally.

reagent-name-experimental-stimulants = experimental stimulants
reagent-desc-experimental-stimulants = A prototype version of the stimulant chemical mixture. Usage grants virtual immunity to stun weaponry, rapid tissue regeneration, extreme running speed by reducing lactic acid buildup, and a general feeling of euphoria. Side effects may include extreme levels of anticoagulation, tunnel vision, extreme toxin buildup in the bloodstream, and rapid liver death. Do not give to animals.

reagent-name-thc = THC
reagent-desc-thc = The main psychoactive compound in cannabis.

reagent-name-thc-oil = THC oil
reagent-desc-thc-oil = Pure THC oil, extracted from the leaves of the cannabis plant. Much stronger than its natural form and can be used to numb chronic pain in patients.

reagent-name-bananadine = bananadine
reagent-desc-bananadine = A mild psychedelic that is found in small traces in banana peels.

reagent-name-nicotine = nicotine
reagent-desc-nicotine = Dangerous and highly addictive, but that's what the propaganda says.

reagent-name-impedrezene = impedrezene
reagent-desc-impedrezene = A narcotic that impedes one's ability by slowing down the higher brain cell functions.

reagent-name-space-drugs = space drugs
reagent-desc-space-drugs = An illegal compound which induces a number of effects such as loss of balance and visual artefacts.

reagent-name-nocturine = nocturine
reagent-desc-nocturine = A highly effective sedative and hypnotic, developed by the Syndicate for stealth operations. One-way ticket to honk-shoo town.

reagent-name-mute-toxin = mute toxin
reagent-desc-mute-toxin = A thick chemical that coats the vocal cords, making the user unable to speak during metabolization.

reagent-name-norepinephric-acid = norepinephric acid
reagent-desc-norepinephric-acid = A smooth chemical that blocks the optical receptors, rendering the user blind during metabolization.

reagent-name-tear-gas = tear gas
reagent-desc-tear-gas = A chemical that causes severe irritation and crying, commonly used in riot control.
