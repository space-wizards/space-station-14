reagent-name-diphenhydramine = diphenhydramine
reagent-desc-diphenhydramine = Rapidly purges the body of histamine and reduces jitteriness.

reagent-name-arithrazine = arithrazine
reagent-desc-arithrazine = A slightly unstable medication used for the most extreme case of radiation poisoning. Lowers radiation level at over twice the rate Hyronalin does and will heal toxin damage at the same time. Deals very minor brute damage to the patient over time, but the patient's body will typically out-regenerate it easily.

reagent-name-bicaridine = bicaridine
reagent-desc-bicaridine = An analgesic which is highly effective at treating brute damage. It's useful for stabilizing people who have been severely beaten, as well as treating less life-threatening injuries. In the case of bleeding (internal or external), bicaridine will slow down the bleeding heavily. If the dosage exceeds the overdose limit, it'll stop it outright.

reagent-name-cryoxadone = cryoxadone
reagent-desc-cryoxadone = Required for the proper function of cryogenics. Heals all standard types of damage very swiftly, but only works in temperatures under 170K (usually this means cryo cells). Can also slowly heal clone damage, such as caused by cloning or Slimes.

reagent-name-dermaline = dermaline
reagent-desc-dermaline = An advanced chemical that is more effective at treating burn damage than Kelotane.

reagent-name-dexalin = dexalin
reagent-desc-dexalin = Used for treating oxygen deprivation. In most cases where it is likely to be needed, the strength of Dexalin Plus will probably be more useful.

reagent-name-dexalin-plus = dexalin plus
reagent-desc-dexalin-plus = Used in treatment of extreme cases of oxygen deprivation. Effective at healing blood loss damage.

reagent-name-epinephrine = epinephrine
reagent-desc-epinephrine = Effective at bringing people back from a critical state. Reduces some stun times. Easy to overdose on.

reagent-name-hyronalin = hyronalin
reagent-desc-hyronalin = A weak treatment for radiation damage. Considered to be useful mainly for genetic modification, where it reduces radiation levels, and thus the chance of genetic mutations. Largely outclassed by Arithrazine.

reagent-name-ipecac = ipecac
reagent-desc-ipecac = Induces vomiting. Useful for stopping a poisoning that isn't done metabolizing.

reagent-name-inaprovaline = inaprovaline
reagent-desc-inaprovaline = Inaprovaline is a synaptic stimulant and cardiostimulant. Commonly used to stabilize patients- it stops oxygen loss when the patient is in critical health. It'll also slow down bleeding by a good amount. Acts as a decent painkiller.

reagent-name-kelotane = kelotane
reagent-desc-kelotane = Treats burn damage and prevents infection.

reagent-name-leporazine = leporazine
reagent-desc-leporazine = This keeps a patient's body temperature stable. High doses can allow short periods of unprotected EVA, but prevents use of the cryogenics tubes.

reagent-name-barozine = barozine
reagent-desc-barozine = A potent drug that prevents pressure damage. Causes extreme pain and jittering. Very poisonous when overdosed.

reagent-name-phalanximine = phalanximine
reagent-desc-phalanximine = Used in the treatment of cancer. Causes moderate radiation poisoning.

reagent-name-romerol = romerol
reagent-desc-romerol = A difficult to procure chemical used in the reversal of the zombification process. Tastes like death.

reagent-name-pulped-banana-peel = pulped banana peel
reagent-desc-pulped-banana-peel = Pulped banana peels have some effectiveness against bleeding.

reagent-name-siderlac = siderlac
reagent-desc-siderlac = A powerful anti-caustic medicine derived from plants.

reagent-name-spaceacillin = spaceacillin
reagent-desc-spaceacillin = A theta-lactam antibiotic. A common and very useful medicine, effective against many diseases likely to be encountered in space. Slows progression of diseases.

reagent-name-stellibinin = stellibinin
reagent-desc-stellibinin = A natual antitoxin with particular effectiveness against amatoxin.

reagent-name-synaptizine = synaptizine
reagent-desc-synaptizine = Toxic, but treats hallucinations, drowsiness & halves the duration of paralysis, stuns and knockdowns. One unit is enough to treat hallucinations; two units is deadly.

reagent-name-tranexamic-acid = tranexamic acid
reagent-desc-tranexamic-acid = A blood clotting medicine for preventing heavy bleeding. Very dangerous in large quantities.

reagent-name-tricordrazine = tricordrazine
reagent-desc-tricordrazine = A wide-spectrum stimulant, originally derived from Cordrazine. It's capable of healing most common damage types simultaneously, however only at about half the rate of other medications. Because of its low potency, it's best used as a supplement to other medicines.

reagent-name-lipozine = lipozine
reagent-desc-lipozine = Causes weight loss upon consumption.

reagent-name-omnizine = omnizine
reagent-desc-omnizine = A soothing milky liquid with an iridescent gleam. A well known conspiracy theory says that it's origins remain a mystery because knowing the secrets of its production would render most commercial pharmaceuticals obsolete.

reagent-name-ultravasculine = ultravasculine
reagent-desc-ultravasculine = Rapidly flushes toxins from the body, but places some stress on the veins. Do not overdose.

reagent-name-oculine = oculine
reagent-desc-oculine = Heals eye damage.

reagent-name-ethylredoxrazine = ethylredoxrazine
reagent-desc-ethylredoxrazine = Neutralises the effects of alcohol in the blood stream. Though it is commonly needed, it is rarely requested.

reagent-name-cognizine = cognizine
reagent-desc-cognizine = A mysterious chemical which is able to make any non-sentient creature sentient.
