command-description-stationevent-lsprob =
    Given a BasicStationEventScheduler prototype, lists the probability of different station events occuring out of the entire pool with current conditions.
command-description-stationevent-lsprobtheoretical =
    Given a BasicStationEventScheduler prototype, player count, and round time, lists the probability of different station events occuring based on the specified number of players and round time.
command-description-stationevent-prob =
