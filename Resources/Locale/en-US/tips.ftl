tips-dataset-74 = As an Engineer, you can use plasma glass to reinforce an area and prevent radiation. Uranium glass can also be used to prevent radiation.
tips-dataset-75 = As the Captain, you are one of the highest priority targets on the station. Everything from revolutions, to nuclear operatives, to traitors that need to rob you of your unique laser pistol or your life are things to worry about.
tips-dataset-76 = As the Captain, always take the nuclear disk and pinpointer with you every shift. It's a good idea to give one of these to another head you can trust with keeping it safe.
tips-dataset-77 = As the Captain, you have absolute access and control over the station, but this does not mean that being a horrible person won't result in mutiny.
tips-dataset-78 = As the Captain, try to be active and patrol the station. Staying in the bridge might be tempting, but you'll just end up putting a bigger target on your back!
tips-dataset-79 = As a Scientist, you can try random things on an artifact while the scanner is on cooldown to speed up the point extraction process significantly.
tips-dataset-80 = As a Scientist, you can utilize upgraded versions of machines to increase its effectiveness. This can make certain machines significantly better; salvage will love you if you upgrade their ore processor!

tips-dataset-86 = As a Chemist, once you've made everything you've needed to, don't be afraid to make more silly reagents. Have you tried desoxyephedrine or licoxide?
tips-dataset-87 = As a Medical Doctor, Chemist, or Chief Medical Officer, you can use chloral hydrate to non-lethally sedate unruly patients.
tips-dataset-88 = Don't be afraid to ask for help, whether from your peers in character or through LOOC, or from admins!
tips-dataset-89 = You'll quickly lose your interest in the game if you play to win and kill. If you find yourself doing this, take a step back and talk to people--it's a much better experience!
tips-dataset-90 = If there's something you need from another department, try asking! This game isn't singleplayer and you'd be surprised what you can get accomplished together!
tips-dataset-91 = The station's nuke is invincible. Go find the disk instead of trying to destroy it.
tips-dataset-92 = Maintenance is full of equipment that is randomized every round. Look around and see if anything is worth using.
tips-dataset-93 = We were all new once, be patient and guide new players, especially those playing intern roles, in the right direction.
tips-dataset-94 = Firesuits, winter coats and emergency EVA suits offer mild protection from the cold, allowing you to spend longer periods of time near breaches and space than if wearing nothing at all.
tips-dataset-95 = In an emergency, you can always rely on firesuits and emergency EVA suits; they will always spawn in their respective lockers. They might be awkward to move around in, but can easily save your life in a dangerous situation.
tips-dataset-96 = In an emergency, remember that you can craft improvised weapons! A baseball bat or spear could easily mean the difference between deterring an attacker or perishing from the hands of one.
tips-dataset-97 = Spears can be tipped with chemicals, and will inject a few units every time you hit someone with them directly.
tips-dataset-98 = You can make spears with reinforced glass, plasma glass, or uranium glass shards to enhance their damage.
tips-dataset-99 = Thrown spears deal extra damage! Beware, however, as throwing them too much will end up breaking them.
tips-dataset-100 = All forms of toxin damage are fairly difficult to treat, and usually involve the use of chemicals or other inconvenient methods. You can use this to your advantage in combat.

tips-dataset-102 = You can put napalm in a backpack water tank to make a flamethrower.
tips-dataset-103 = Some jobs have alternate uniforms in their respective drobe vendors. Don't be afraid to try out a new look!
tips-dataset-104 = Speed is almost everything in combat. Using hardsuits just for their armor is usually a terrible idea unless the resistances it provides are geared towards combat, or you're not planning to go head-first into the fray.
tips-dataset-105 = Just because a job can't be a traitor at the beginning of a round doesn't mean that they'll never be a traitor.

tips-dataset-128 = There is a chemical metabolism limit that limits the amount of reagents of a certain type you can digest at once. Certain species have higher metabolism limits, such as slimes.
tips-dataset-129 = Welding without proper eye protection can cause eye damage, which must be cured with oculine.
tips-dataset-130 = Zombies are very vulnerable to heat damage, making welding tools and laser guns extremely effective against them.
tips-dataset-131 = You can weld glass shards into glass sheets.
tips-dataset-132 = By right clicking on a player, and then clicking the heart icon, you can quickly examine them to check for injuries or how badly they're bleeding. You can also do this to yourself.
