tips-dataset-35 = As a Traitor, any purchased grenade penguins won't attack you, and will explode if killed.
tips-dataset-36 = As a Traitor, be careful when using vestine from the chemical synthesis kit. If someone checks your station, they could easily out you.
tips-dataset-37 = As a Traitor, remember that power sinks will create a loud sound and alert the crew after running for long enough. Try to hide them in a tricky-to-find spot, or reinforce the area around them so that they're harder to reach.
tips-dataset-38 = As a Traitor, plasma gas is an excellent way to create chaos. It can be ignited to make an area extra-uninhabitable, and can cause toxin damage to those that inhale it.

tips-dataset-42 = As a Nuclear Operative, communication is key! Use your radio to speak to your fellow operatives and coordinate an attack plan.

tips-dataset-49 = As a Salvage Specialist, try asking science for a tethergun. It can be used to grab items off of salvage wrecks extremely efficiently!
tips-dataset-50 = As a Salvage Specialist, try asking science for a grappling hook. It can be used to propel yourself onto wrecks, or if stuck in space you don't have to rely on the proto-kinetic accelerator.
tips-dataset-51 = Tip #51 does not exist and has never existed. Ignore any rumors to the contrary.
tips-dataset-52 = As a Salvage Specialist, consider cooperating with the Cargo Technicians. They can order you a wide variety of useful items, including ones that may be hard to get otherwise, such laser guns and shuttle building materials.

tips-dataset-76 = As the Captain, always take the nuclear disk and pinpointer with you every shift. It's a good idea to give one of these to another head you can trust with keeping it safe.
tips-dataset-77 = As the Captain, you have absolute access and control over the station, but this does not mean that being a horrible person won't result in mutiny.
tips-dataset-78 = As the Captain, try to be active and patrol the station. Staying in the bridge might be tempting, but you'll just end up putting a bigger target on your back!
tips-dataset-79 = As a Scientist, you can try random things on an artifact while the scanner is on cooldown to speed up the point extraction process significantly.

tips-dataset-86 = As a Chemist, once you've made everything you've needed to, don't be afraid to make more silly reagents. Have you tried desoxyephedrine or licoxide?
tips-dataset-87 = As a Medical Doctor, Chemist, or Chief Medical Officer, you can use chloral hydrate to non-lethally sedate unruly patients.
tips-dataset-88 = Don't be afraid to ask for help, whether from your peers in character or through LOOC, or from admins!
tips-dataset-89 = You'll quickly lose your interest in the game if you play to win and kill. If you find yourself doing this, take a step back and talk to people--it's a much better experience!
tips-dataset-90 = If there's something you need from another department, try asking! This game isn't singleplayer and you'd be surprised what you can get accomplished together!
tips-dataset-91 = The station's nuke is invincible. Go find the disk instead of trying to destroy it.
tips-dataset-92 = Maintenance is full of equipment that is randomized every round. Look around and see if anything is worth using.
tips-dataset-93 = We were all new once, be patient and guide new players, especially those playing intern roles, in the right direction.
tips-dataset-94 = Firesuits, winter coats and emergency EVA suits offer mild protection from the cold, allowing you to spend longer periods of time near breaches and space than if wearing nothing at all.

tips-dataset-96 = In an emergency, remember that you can craft improvised weapons! A baseball bat or spear could easily mean the difference between deterring an attacker or perishing from the hands of one.
tips-dataset-97 = Spears can be tipped with chemicals, and will inject a few units every time you hit someone with them directly.
tips-dataset-98 = You can make spears with reinforced glass, plasma glass, or uranium glass shards to enhance their damage.
tips-dataset-99 = Thrown spears deal extra damage! Beware, however, as throwing them too much will end up breaking them.

tips-dataset-102 = You can put napalm in a backpack water tank to make a flamethrower.
tips-dataset-103 = Some jobs have alternate uniforms in their respective drobe vendors. Don't be afraid to try out a new look!
tips-dataset-104 = Speed is almost everything in combat. Using hardsuits just for their armor is usually a terrible idea unless the resistances it provides are geared towards combat, or you're not planning to go head-first into the fray.
tips-dataset-105 = Just because a job can't be a traitor at the beginning of a round doesn't mean that they'll never be a traitor.

tips-dataset-113 = Fire can spread to other players through touch! Be careful around flaming bodies or large crowds with people on fire in them.

tips-dataset-120 = You can stun grenade penguins, which can bide valuable time for you to kill them.
tips-dataset-121 = You can click on the names of items to pick them up in the right click menu, instead of hovering over the item and then selecting pick up.
tips-dataset-122 = Space Station 14 is open source! If there's a change you want to make, or a simple item you want to add, then try contributing to the game. It's not as hard as you'd think it is.
tips-dataset-123 = In a pinch, you can throw drinks or other reagent containers behind you to create a spill that can slip people chasing you.

tips-dataset-126 = If you're not a human, you can drink blood to heal back some of your blood volume, albeit very inefficiently.
tips-dataset-127 = If you're a human, don't drink blood! It makes you sick and you'll begin to take damage.
tips-dataset-128 = There is a chemical metabolism limit that limits the amount of reagents of a certain type you can digest at once. Certain species have higher metabolism limits, such as slimes.
tips-dataset-129 = Welding without proper eye protection can cause eye damage, which must be cured with oculine.
tips-dataset-130 = Zombies are very vulnerable to heat damage, making welding tools and laser guns extremely effective against them.
tips-dataset-131 = You can weld glass shards into glass sheets.
tips-dataset-132 = By right clicking on a player, and then clicking the heart icon, you can quickly examine them to check for injuries or how badly they're bleeding. You can also do this to yourself.

tips-dataset-134 = You can tell if an area with firelocks up is spaced by looking to see if the firelocks have lights beside them.
