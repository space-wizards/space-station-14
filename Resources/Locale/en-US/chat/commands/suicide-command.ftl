cmd-suicide-desc = Commits suicide
cmd-suicide-help = The suicide command gives you a quick way out of a round while remaining in-character.
                   The method varies, first it will attempt to use the held item in your active hand.
                   If that fails, it will attempt to use an object in the environment.
                   Finally, if neither of the above worked, you will die by biting your tongue.

cmd-suicide-default-text-others = {CAPITALIZE(THE($name))} is attempting to bite {POSS-ADJ($name)} own tongue!
cmd-suicide-default-text-self = You attempt to bite your own tongue!
cmd-suicide-already-dead = You can't suicide. You're dead.
cmd-suicide-no-mind = You have no mind!
cmd-suicide-denied = You cannot suicide right now.
