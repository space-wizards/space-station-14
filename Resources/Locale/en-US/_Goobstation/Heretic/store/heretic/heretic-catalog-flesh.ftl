knowledge-path-flesh-s1-name = Principle of Hunger
knowledge-path-flesh-s1-desc =
    Hundreds of us starved, but not me... I found strength in my greed.

    Opens up the Path of Flesh to you.
    Allows you to transmute a knife and a pool of blood into a Bloody Blade. Limit of two at a time.

knowledge-path-flesh-s2-name = Grasp of Flesh
knowledge-path-flesh-s2-desc =
    My new found desires drove me to greater and greater heights.

    Your Mansus Grasp gains the ability to create a ghoul out of corpse with a soul.
    Ghouls have only 50 health and look like husks to the heathens' eyes, but can use Bloody Blades effectively.
    All ghouls get their own bloody blade that cannot be shattered and disappears on ghoul death.

knowledge-path-flesh-s3-name = Imperfect Ritual
knowledge-path-flesh-s3-desc =
    I found notes of a dark ritual, unfinished... yet still, I pushed forward.

    Allows you to transmute a corpse and a muzzle to create a Voiceless Dead.
    The corpse does not need to have a soul.
    Voiceless Dead are mute ghouls and only have 100 health, but can use Bloody Blades effectively.

knowledge-path-flesh-s4-name = Mark of Flesh
knowledge-path-flesh-s4-desc =
    That's when I saw them, the marked ones. They were out of reach. They screamed, and screamed.

    Your Mansus Grasp now applies the Mark of Flesh. The mark is triggered from an attack with your Bloody Blade.
    When triggered, the victim violently spills all it's blood on the ground.

knowledge-path-flesh-s5-name = Knitting of Flesh
knowledge-path-flesh-s5-desc =
    But they were not out of my reach for long. With every step, the screams grew, until at last
    I learned that they could be silenced.

    Grants you the spell Knit Flesh. This spell allows you to remove organs from victims
    without requiring a lengthy surgery. This process is much longer if the target is not dead.
    This spell also allows you to heal your minions and summons, or restore failing organs to acceptable status.

knowledge-path-flesh-s6-name = Raw Ritual
knowledge-path-flesh-s6-desc =
    I could not continue alone. I was able to summon The Uncanny Man to help me see more.
    The screams... once constant, now silenced by their wretched appearance. Nothing was out of reach.

    Allows you to transmute a pair of eyes, a stomach, and a pool of blood to create a Raw Prophet.
    Raw Prophets have a long range jaunt and the ability to link minds to communicate with ease, but are very fragile and weak in combat.

knowledge-path-flesh-s7-name = Bleeding Steel
knowledge-path-flesh-s7-desc =
    The Uncanny Man was not alone. They led me to the Marshal.
    I finally began to understand. And then, blood rained from the heavens.

    Your Bloody Blade now causes enemies to bleed heavily on attack.

knowledge-path-flesh-s8-name = Lonely Ritual
knowledge-path-flesh-s8-desc =
    I was able to combine my greed and desires to summon an eldritch beast I had never seen before.
    An ever shapeshifting mass of flesh, it knew well my goals. The Marshal approved.

    Allows you to transmute a heart, a stomach, lungs and a pen to create a Stalker.
    Stalkers can jaunt, release EMPs, and are strong in combat.

knowledge-path-flesh-s9-name = Priest’s Final Hymn
knowledge-path-flesh-s9-desc =
    The ascension ritual of the Path of Flesh. Bring 4 corpses to a transmutation rune to complete the ritual.
    When completed, you instantly shed your human form and become the Lord of the Night, a supremely powerful creature.
    Just the act of transforming causes nearby heathens great fear and trauma.
    While in the Lord of the Night form, you can consume the living to heal.
    You will also become immune to flames, space, and similar environmental hazards.

    WARNING - THIS RITUAL IS A POINT OF NO RETURN. YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO TRANSFORM BACK AFTER THE RITUAL IS PERFORMED!
