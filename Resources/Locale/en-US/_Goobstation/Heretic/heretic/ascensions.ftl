heretic-ascension-ash =
    The Watch is dead, the Nightwatcher burned with it. Yet his fire burns evermore,
    for the Nightwatcher brought forth the rite to mankind! His gaze continues, as now I am one with the flames,
    WITNESS MY ASCENSION, THE ASHY LANTERN BLAZES ONCE MORE!

heretic-ascension-blade =
    The Torn Champion is freed! I will become the blade reunited, and with my greater ambition,
    I AM UNMATCHED! A STORM OF STEEL AND SILVER IS UPON US! WITNESS MY ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-lock =
    The Stewards guided me, and I guided them.
    My foes were the Locks and my blades were the Key!
    The Labyrinth will be Locked no more, and freedom will be ours! WITNESS US!

heretic-ascension-flesh =
    With the Marshal's knowledge, my power had peaked. The throne was open to claim.
    Men of this world, hear me, for the time has come! The Marshal guides my army!
    Reality will bend to THE LORD OF THE NIGHT or be unraveled! WITNESS MY ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-void =
    The world falls into darkness. I stand in an empty plane, small flakes of ice fall from the sky.
    The Aristocrat stands before me, beckoning. We will play a waltz to the whispers of dying reality,
    as the world is destroyed before our eyes. The void will return all to nothing, WITNESS MY ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-rust =
    Champion of rust. Corruptor of steel. Fear the dark, for the RUSTBRINGER has come!
    The Blacksmith forges ahead! Rusted Hills, CALL MY NAME! WITNESS MY ASCENSION!
