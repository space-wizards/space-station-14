[color=#a4885c]The[/color] [color=#ffd700]Golden[/color] [color=#a4885c]Rule.[/color] Admins can disregard any and all of these rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large. They will of course be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege.

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Don’t be a dick. We’re all here to have fun. Antagonists have leeway here since ruining the round is kind of their job, but try to keep it interesting if you’re antag.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Erotic Roleplay (ERP) is [color=#ff0000]not allowed under any circumstance[/color].

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Harassment of other players for OOC/meta reasons is [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].
	- Annoying somebody in a round for IC/RP reasons is fine. Doing it consistently across multiple rounds for OOC reasons (“I don’t like this 		  player” AKA metagrudging) to the point where it becomes seriously problematic for the other player(s) is [color=#ff0000]not[/color].

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] Hate speech, slurs and bigotry are not allowed.
	- Intentionally seeking to demean others due to their actual or perceived race, sex, gender, orientation or the like is not tolerated.
	- Words that are closely tied to real life slurs are [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Offensive/bad character names put you at the mercy of administrators, from receiving brain damage to becoming valid to straight up getting banned on the spot depending on how bad they are.

[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] Knowingly performing activities that can slowdown or crash the server is [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] Multi-keying/Alts on the same server is [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].
	- Admins may ask players in possession of multiple alt accounts to choose one to play on and ban the other accounts.
	- If you are caught knowingly using alt accounts you may have your main account banned as well.

[color=#a4885c]8.[/color] Using information gained outside the game to your advantage is [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color]. IC and OOC are to be kept separate at all times.
	- Metacommunication, or communicating with other players via out of game methods (such as Discord) to gain an unfair advantage is also strictly [color=#ff0000]prohibited[/color].
	- Random PDA checks are also [color=#ff0000]prohibited[/color] under this rule.
