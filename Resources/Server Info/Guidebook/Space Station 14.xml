# Space Station 14

Welcome to the pre-alpha of Space Station 14! We hope you enjoy the game, and this entry will serve to guide you on how to learn to play. There's quite a bit to read, but SS14 is in itself a very large and in-depth game, and hopefully these guides help you enjoy it to it's fullest.

## What this is
Space Station 14 is a free (forever) open source remake of the infamous Space Station 13, hoping to provide a improved experience for both newcomers and old players alike. Space Station 14 is designed as a fully moddable experience that you can modify to your liking with custom servers, adding entire swaths of new content for people to explore.

If you're just here to play, that's great! The [color=#a4885c]Where to start[/color] section of this entry will help you out, if you're looking to do a bit more with the game, you can join our discord and find our github page in the lobby.

## Where to start
It's recommended to start with the [color=#a4885c]Controls[/color] guide, and then read the [color=#a4885c]Character Creation[/color], [color=#a4885c]Roleplaying[/color], and [color=#a4885c]Jobs[/color] guides. Not all jobs or concepts will have guides yet, and it's strongly encouraged to help us write them if you're an experienced player!
