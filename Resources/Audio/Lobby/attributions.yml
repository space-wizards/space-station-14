  copyright: "Flip Flap by X-ceed is licensed under a short but clear license (see flip-flap.txt in this directory) and is free for non-commercial use. It was converted from MOD to WAV using Schism Tracker, in 16 Bit, Non-Interpolated mode, no output equalizer settings, Ramp volume at start of sample enabled. From there it was converted to OGG Vorbis with `ffmpeg -i flip-flap.wav -q 2.9 flip-flap-renc.ogg` (quality scale chosen to match size of the OGG file being replaced). Non-interpolated mode was chosen as the module has a high enough sample rate to balance it out, but seems muffled in other interpolation modes. If 'Ramp volume at start of sample' is not enabled, a clicking phenomenon results."
