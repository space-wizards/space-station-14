mod.flip-flap.ogg (Flip Flap) by X-ceed is licensed under a short but clear license (see flip-flap.txt) and is free for non-commercial use. The source can be found here: http://aminet.net/package/mods/xceed/Flipflap
It was converted from MOD to WAV using Schism Tracker, in 16 Bit, Non-Interpolated mode, no output equalizer settings, Ramp volume at start of sample enabled.
From there it was converted to OGG Vorbis with `ffmpeg -i flip-flap.wav -q 2.9 flip-flap-renc.ogg` (quality scale chosen to match size of the OGG file being replaced).
Non-interpolated mode was chosen as the module has a high enough sample rate to balance it out, but seems muffled in other interpolation modes.
If "Ramp volume at start of sample" is not enabled, a clicking phenomenon results.
