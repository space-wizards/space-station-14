# Licensing configuration file

# Used by `Tools/rga_check.py` for making sure that all assets have attribution, valid licenses,
# that custom licenses have their files properly recorded, and various other asset compliance checks


# Flag that designates the project as non-commercial and stops the script from screaming about license violation
# Make sure to flip this off if you're unsure about commerciality of your project
# This is purely for own checking of assets in your project
projectIsNonCommercial: true


# Checks to ignore for running the script without other parameters
# Useful if you want to ensure linting in CI, but can't turn on full compliance checking yet
# See ValidationFailure enum for values
checksIgnored:
- SOURCE_UNKNOWN
- UNATTRIBUTED
- FILE_ATTRIBUTIONS_MISSING
- LICENSE_CUSTOM_UNCLARIFIED


# HTTP/HTTPS doesn't matter here
# Use "url" or "urls" keys to add a single or multiple sources. Don't combine all similar sources together though
# "reason" field - describes why the source should be accepted or rejected
# Keep this list in order from least to most specific, as acceptance/rejection can be overridden by more specific source later
