-	Make flare spent
--			Give: Passenger PDA/ID (name?), Ancient jumpsuit, gas mask, budget insuls,
				shoes, bling, ID computer board in pocket
- Stuff that gets flushed down toilets, aside from the mime and clowns', goes to the QM's shower for some reason.
	Figure out mail chutes first, though.
Evac:
-	Rename + fill ore crates
-	Decals, of course
- Make the station move forward!
- Job numbers in the prototype file
Figure out wrong-facing wall TVs, telescreens, nanomeds (others?)
Command Meeting: Needs access to execution cameras
Execution telescreens: Need access to execution cameras
Cargo shuttle computer can't find the shuttle. Mass scanner says it's out there...
Forms for things like borging, department access, psych prescriptions...
	Make lots of forms for HoP, too
		Hall/Bathroom Pass
		Official requisition form requisition form
		Complaints
		Opinion Registration
		Tattle Form
		ID Card Alteration Request
		All Access Request
		Some Access Request
		No Access Request
Custom books on lawyer shelves?
Among Us "clues" on detective notice boards
Papers on the ground? for explaining things to
	lawyers on spawn
	Or maybe I just put one spawn in each office and
	let them figure it out from there. Maybe a paper
	on each table. Like, a "congrats! You've passed the
	NT bar exam for: Defense Attorney!"
Shrink or move HoP tunnel to expand Atmos a bit more?
Would it be too radical to totally left/right swap the Atmos
	gas chambers so that the disposal pipeline linkup is less terrible?
	This impacts distro pipeline as well, naturally, so dunno.
	It might be nice to have the spaced area between the tanks
		and the burn chamber, just for a bit of a buffer zone.
		Ditto the public hallway, too, though...
Fill CMO's special syringe
Cryo piping
Check various shuttle designs to make sure docking arms line up with at least some
Telecoms: Change reinforced walls?
Move warden's office?
Make easier to navigate in general, + add standard colors around more
	Maybe crappy scribble decals on top of the MIRI flooring?
Take out empty trit can?
Deal with very long TEG pipeline somehow.
Swap nuke/PA? Move nuke to vault?
Move oxy miner to where the other gasses are?
Set ejection chamber button access (cap and HoS)
Nudge wall sign transform variables to make them line up better
One missing Amogus camera: Admin (probably because of fix wiring)
Salvage space arm is getting sensed as part of the room by air sensors?
Weapons north maints door stuck open
Somewhere, there is a holopad with no label.
I'd really like the sec camera monitors to only see General if possible...
	And I think I already have it on this list, but the Admin camera still no worky.
Det/Prosc door bolt doesn't work. It bolts, then immediately unbolts.
	nor instead of or gate?


The big things:
Set up evac shuttle (possibly shrink it, too)
Cafeteria firelocks
Cafeteria floor
Possibly move Evac farther out to make room for shuttle
	at north dock.
Grime everything up a bit again.

Check this stuff:
Holopads with custom names that aren't generic holopads
Holopad perms
Janitor air alarm not powered, even when power is fixed.
	Moved Admin cable away a bit, maybe did the trick?
Tider shop:
	Should also be a light by the door. Maybe it turns off when
		door is bolted?
		Added one. CHECK IF IT WORKS. Make sure door's still
			bolted at start, too.
Execution telescreens see mounted cam networks, not wireless.
	Having trouble figuring out where this is specified, so maybe I should
		dig into the components while testing live.
- Make sure I can interact with posters correctly
AI scrubber vent pump starts off
	Turned it on, should check it sticks when live
	If this works, probs turn on some other Atmos stuff, too
Check lighting
Make sure arrivals meteor shield didn't block the shuttle
Make sure det/prosc door switches do what they're supposed to. Especially wrt the shutter.
Even without holopad, the hallway engie camera can see CE's outer office.
	Moved it. Maybe fixed. There's always curtains.
Vision of service hall little room near caf through the window
	For some reason, this is the camera in the main arrivals hallway, even though it should have a wall blocking it.
		Camera vision range is clearly screwy.
			Would moving cameras off of the corners of walls fix this?
				no.
		I moved it.
Atmos waste system isn't set to right filters?
	Should be set now
Cargo computer shutter button seems not to be hooked up.
	It is, though...? Does the directional window block it?
Weird color room in east service maints starts with lights on
	I turned them off. Did it work?
Chef's closets have stuff in 'em they shouldn't? Like, crowbars and N2 tanks.
	Double-check if this is even true
Not much vision of arti/anom hall
	This is confusing, and I need to investigate more. The camera on the east side should see just fine, and the camera on the west side should get anything it misses.


THINGS I COULD MAKE:
- Plastic table
- Round table ends
- Random wall girder things
- Wood but it's darker (and lighter?)
- Feather, whip for prosecutor - and defense/prosecution signs?
-- Also a toupee for when they're feeling payne.
-- And a dang gavel
- Huge thrusters?

/* Anything I can do to give poor Atmos more room to work with... */
/* Bridge front window very prone to spacing */
/* Engineering break room also prone to spacing */
/* Make AI less de-grid-able */
/* More arrivals meteor protection */
/* Also: When I'm testing in Release mode, I get these exceptions in the server terminal */

/* No vision of TEG burn chamber. */
/* 	Maybe this is fine. */
/* Assembly camera still in salv airlock (but AI gets vision through glass doors anyway) */

/* AI Cameras: */
/* -Engi locker room + that other little one */
/* -Engi hallway */
/* -West half of Reactor */

/* 	Otherwise, I can only use cameras set to an actual department network. */
/* 	...or the "Camera [Constructed]" also. */
/* Also, the tripod-mounted cams do give me vision. Or do they? */
/* 	The one in meeting room did. Maybe it's set to a different network than the ones I'm creating */
/* 		on the fly. */

/* StationAiVisionComponent */
/* 	-I should take this out of some holopads and call them "Private Holopad" */

/* AI room's south side hall, when small firelock is shut, can't be traversed. */
/* Maybe some railings to protect from HV grilles, too. */
/* 	Not just on AI walk, but in general, make it a bit less easy to just bump into those */

/* 		Needs more protection from that? */
/* 	Also, some wires under walls in space. Not so great. */
/* Vision of HoP/Bridge shortcut *does* see secret door. */
/* 	Clearly, moving the camera off the corner wouldn't fix this, too, as it's on the other corner. :C */
/* 		I can't really do that anyway. */
/* 	I just took it out entirely. Eh. */
