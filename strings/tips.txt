Where the space map levels connect is randomized every round, but are otherwise kept consistent within rounds. Remember that they are not necessarily bidirectional!
You can catch thrown items by toggling on your throw mode with an empty hand active.
To crack the safe in the vault, use a stethoscope or three plastic explosives on it.
You can climb onto a table by dragging yourself onto one. This takes time and drops the items in your hands on the table. Clicking on a table that someone else is climbing onto will knock them down.
You can drag other players onto yourself to open the strip menu, letting you remove their equipment or force them to wear something. Note that exosuits or helmets will block your access to the clothing beneath them, and that certain items take longer to strip or put on than others.
Clicking on a windoor rather then bumping into it will keep it open, you can click it again to close it.
You can spray a fire extinguisher, throw items or fire a gun while floating through space to change your direction. Simply fire opposite to where you want to go.
You can change the control scheme by pressing tab. One is WASD, the other is the arrow keys. Keep in mind that hotkeys are also changed with this.
Firesuits and winter coats offer mild protection from the cold, allowing you to spend longer periods of time near breaches and space than if wearing nothing at all.
Glass shards can be welded to make glass, and metal rods can be welded to make metal. Ores can be welded too, but this takes a lot of fuel.
If you need to drag multiple people either to safety or to space, bring a locker or crate over and stuff them all in before hauling them off.
You can grab someone by clicking on them with the grab intent, then upgrade the grab by clicking on them once more. An aggressive grab will momentarily stun someone, allow you to place them on a table by clicking on it, or throw them by toggling on throwing.
Holding alt and left clicking a tile will allow you to see its contents in the top right window pane, which is much faster than right clicking.
The resist button will allow you to resist out of handcuffs, being buckled to a chair or bed, out of locked lockers and more. Whenever you're stuck, try resisting!
You can move an item out of the way by dragging it and then clicking on an adjacent tile with an empty hand.
You can recolor certain items like jumpsuits and gloves in washing machines by also throwing in a crayon.
Maintenance is full of equipment that is randomized every round. Look around and see if anything is worth using.
Some roles cannot be antagonists by default, but antag selection is decided first. For instance, you can set Security Officer to High without affecting your chances of becoming an antag -- the game will just select a different role.
There are many places around the station to hide contraband. A few for starters: linen boxes, toilet cisterns, body bags. Experiment to find more!
You can use a machine in the vault to deposit cash or rob Cargo's department funds.
When in doubt about technicial issues, clear your cache (byond launcher > cogwheel > preferences > game prefs), update your BYOND, and relog.
Most things have special interactions with your middle mouse button, alt, shift, and control click. Experiment!
You can screwdriver any non-chemical grenade to shorten fuses from 5 seconds, to 3 seconds, to 1 second, to instant boom! Nobody ever expects this.
If you find yourself in a fistfight with another player, staying on the offensive is usually the smart move. Running away often won't accomplish much.
Different weapons have different strengths. Some weapons, such as spears, floor tiles, and throwing stars, deal more damage when thrown compared to when attacked normally.
A thrown glass of water can make a slippery tile, allowing you to slow down your pursuers in a pinch.
When dealing with security, you can often get your sentence negated entirely through cooperation and deception.
The P2P chat function found on tablet computers allows for a stealthy way to communicate with people.
Experiment with different setups of the supermatter engine to maximize output, but don't risk the crew's safety to do so!
We were all new once, be patient and guide new players in the right direction.
On most clothing items that go in the exosuit slot, you can put certain small items into your suit storage, such as a spraycan, your emergency oxygen tank, or a flashlight.
Most job-related exosuit clothing can fit job-related items into it, such as the atmospheric technician's hardsuit/winter coat holding an RPD, or labcoats holding most medicine.
If you're using hotkey mode, you can stop pulling things using H.
The station's self-destruct terminal is invincible. Go find the disk instead of trying to destroy it.
If there's something you need from another department, try asking! This game isn't singleplayer and you'd be surprised what you can get accomplished together!
You'll quickly lose your interest in the game if you play to win and kill. If you find yourself doing this, take a step back and talk to people - it's a much better experience!
Felinids get temporarily distracted by laser pointers. Use this to your advantage when being pursued by one.
Don't be afraid to ask for help, whether from your peers or from admins.
As the Captain, you are one of the highest priority targets on the station. Everything from revolutions, to nuclear operatives, to traitors that need to rob you of your unique lasgun or your life are things to worry about.
As the Captain, always take the nuclear disk and pinpointer with you every shift. It's a good idea to give one of these to another head you can trust with keeping it safe.
As the Captain, you have absolute access and control over the station, but this does not mean that being a horrible person won't result in mutiny and a ban.

As an Engineer, your RCD can be reloaded with metal, glass or plasteel sheets instead of just compressed matter cartridges.
As an Engineer, the Supermatter Monitoring Program on modular computers give you a detailed report on the Supermatter's condition, and the contents of the air inside of the chamber, allowing you to both diagnose and monitor programs from afar!
As an Atmospheric Technician, you can unwrench a pipe regardless of the pressures of the gases inside, but if they're too high they can burst out and injure you!
As an Atmospheric Technician, look into replacing your gas pumps with volumetric gas pumps, as those move air in flat numerical amounts, rather than percentages which leave trace gases.
As an Atmospheric Technician, you are better suited to fighting fires than anyone else. As such, you have access to better firesuits, backpack firefighter tanks, and a completely heat and fire proof rigsuit.
As an Atmospheric Technician, your backpack firefighter tank can launch resin. This resin will extinguish fires and replace any gases with a safe, room-temperature airmix.
As an Atmospheric Technician, your ATMOS holofan projector blocks gases while allowing objects to pass through. With it, you can quickly contain gas spills, fires and hull breaches. Or, use it to seal a plasmaman cloning room.
As an Atmospheric Technician, burning a plasma/oxygen mix inside the incinerator will not only produce power, but also gases such as tritium, water vapor and carbon dioxide.
As an Atmospheric Technician, you can change the layer of a pipe by clicking with it on a wrenched pipe or other atmos component of the desired layer.
As the Head of Security, you are expected to coordinate your security force to handle any threat that comes to the station. Sometimes it means making use of the armory to handle a blob, sometimes it means being ruthless during a revolution or cult.
As the Head of Security, you can call for executions or forced cyborgization, but may require the Captain's approval.
As the Head of Security, don't let the power go to your head. You may have high access, great equipment, and a miniature army at your side, but being a terrible person without a good reason is grounds for banning.
As the Warden, your duty is to be the watchdog of the brig and handler of prisoners when little is happening, and to hand out equipment and weapons to the security officers when a crisis strikes.
As the Warden, keep a close eye on the armory at all times, as it is a favored strike point of nuclear operatives and cocky traitors.
As the Warden, if a prisoner's crimes are heinous enough you can put them in permabrig or the gulag. Make sure to check on them once in a while!
As the Warden, you can implant criminals you suspect might re-offend with devices that will track their location and allow you to remotely inject them with disabling chemicals. 
As the Warden, you can use handcuffs on orange prisoner shoes to turn them into cuffed shoes, forcing prisoners to walk and potentially thwarting an escape.
As a Security Officer, communicate and coordinate with your fellow officers using the security channel (:s) to avoid confusion.
As a Security Officer, your sechuds or HUDsunglasses can not only see crewmates' job assignments and criminal status, but also if they are mindshield implanted. You can tell by the flashing blue outline around their job icon. Use this to your advantage in a revolution to definitively tell who is on your side!
As a Security Officer, mindshield implants can only prevent someone from being turned into a cultist: unlike revolutionaries, it will not de-cult them if they have already been converted.
As a Security Officer, examining someone while wearing sechuds or HUDsunglasses will let you set their arrest level, which will cause Beepsky and other security bots to chase after them.
As the Detective, people leave fingerprints everywhere and on everything. With the exception of white latex, gloves will hide them. All is not lost, however, as gloves leave fibers specific to their kind such as black or nitrile, pointing to a general department.
As the Detective, you can use your forensics scanner from a distance.
As the Detective, your revolver can be loaded with .357 ammunition obtained from a hacked autolathe. Firing it has a decent chance to blow up your revolver.

As the Lawyer, you can try to convince the captain and Head of Security to hold trials for prisoners in the courtroom.
As the Head of Personnel, you are not higher ranking than other heads of staff, even though you are expected to take the Captain's place first should he go missing. If the situation seems too rough for you, consider allowing another head to become temporary Captain.
As the Head of Personnel, you are just as large a target as the Captain because of the potential power your ID and computer can hand out.
As the Mime, your invisible wall power blocks people as well as projectiles. You can use it in a pinch to delay your pursuer.
As the Mime, you can use :r and :l to speak through your ventriloquist dummy.
As the Mime, your oath of silence is your source of power. Breaking it robs you of your powers and of your honor.

As the Chaplain, your null rod has anti magic functions: it can destroy cultist runes by hitting them, and it makes you immune to wizard spells and cult magic.
As the Chaplain, your bible is also a container that can store small items. Depending on your god, your starting bible may come with a surprise!
As the Chaplain, you are much more likely to get a response by praying to the gods than most people. To boost your chances, make altars with colorful crayon runes, lit candles, and wire art.
As a Botanist, you can hack the MegaSeed Vendor to get access to more exotic seeds. These seeds can alternatively be ordered from cargo.
As a Botanist, you can mutate the plants growing in your hydroponics trays with unstable mutagen from chemistry or, as an alternative, grow glowshrooms for their radium which also mutates plants to start you up! You can also take uranium out of the servicelathe and grind that up to mutate plants, isn't science amazing?
As a Botanist, you should look into increasing the potency of your plants. This increases the size, amount of chemicals, points gained from grinding them in the biogenerator, and lets people know you are a proficient botanist.
As a Botanist, you can combine production trait chemicals just like a Chemist. Chlorine (blumpkin) + radium and phosphorus (glowshrooms) equals unstable mutagen!
As a Cook, you can load your food into snack vending machines.
As a Cook, you can create a very wide variety of food with the crafting menu. You can find it by looking for the hammer icon near your intents.
As a Cook, you can rename your custom made food with a pen.
As a Cook, any food you make will be much healthier than the junk food found in vendors. Having the crew routinely eating from you will provide minor buffs.
As a Cook, being in the kitchen will make you remember the basics of Close Quarters Cooking. It is highly effective at removing Assistants from your workplace.
As a Cook, most non-custom foods will have a secondary effect, ranging from healing you to making you move at lightspeed. Experiment!
As the Bartender, the drinks you start with only give you the basics. If you want more advanced mixtures, look into working with chemistry, hydroponics, or even mining for things to grind up and throw in!
As the Bartender, you can use a circular saw on your shotgun to make it easier to store.
As a Janitor, if someone steals your janicart, you can instead use your space cleaner spray, grenades, water sprayer, exact bloody revenge or order another from Cargo.

As a Cargo Technician, you can hack MULEbots to make them faster, run over people in their way, and even let you ride them!
As a Cargo Technician, you can order contraband items from the supply shuttle console by de-constructing it and using a multitool on the circuit board, the re-assembling it.
As a Cargo Technician, you can earn more cargo points by shipping back crates from maintenance, liquid containers, plasma sheets, rare seeds from hydroponics, and more!
As the Quartermaster, be sure to check the manifests on crates you receive to make sure all the info is correct. If there's a mistake, stamp the manifest DENIED and send it back in a crate with the items untouched for a refund!
As the Quartermaster, you can construct an express supply console that instantly delivers crates by drop pod. The impact will cause a small explosion as well.
As a Shaft Miner, the northern side of Lavaland has a lot more rare minerals than on the south.
As a Shaft Miner, every monster on Lavaland has a pattern you can exploit to minimize damage from the encounters.
As a Shaft Miner, you can harvest goliath plates from goliaths and upgrade your explorer's suit, mining hardsuits as well as Firefighter APLUs with them, greatly reducing incoming melee damage.

As a Shaft Miner, you can craft a variety of equipment from the local fauna. Bone axes, lava boats and ash drake armour are just a few of them!
As a Traitor, the cryptographic sequencer (emag) can not only open doors, but also lockers, crates, APCs and more. It can hack cyborgs, and even cause bots to go berserk. Use it on the right machines, and you can even order more traitor gear or contact the Syndicate. Experiment!
As a Traitor, subverting the AI to serve you can make it an extremely powerful ally. However, be careful of the wording in the laws you give it, as it may use your poorly written laws against you!
As a Traitor, the Captain and the Head of Security are two of the most difficult to kill targets on the station. If either one is your target, plan carefully.

As a Nuclear Operative, communication is key! Use ; to speak to your fellow operatives and coordinate an attack plan.
As a Nuclear Operative, you should look into purchasing a syndicate cyborg, as they can provide heavy fire support, full access, are immune to conventional stuns, and can easily take down the AI.
As a Nuclear Operative, stick together! While your equipment is robust, your fellow operatives are much better at saving your life: they can drag you away from danger while stunned and provide cover fire.
As a Nuclear Operative, you might end up in a situation where the AI has bolted you into a room. Having some spare C4 in your pocket can save your life.
As a Monkey, you can crawl through air or scrubber vents by alt+left clicking them. You must drop everything you are wearing and holding to do this, however.
As a Monkey, you can still wear a few human items, such as backpacks, gas masks and hats, and still have two free hands.
As the Malfunctioning AI, you can shunt to an APC if the situation gets bad. This disables your doomsday device if it is active.
As the Malfunctioning AI, you should either order your cyborgs to dismantle the robotics console or blow it up yourself in order to protect them.
As the Malfunctioning AI, look into flooding the station with plasma fires to kill off large portions of the crew, letting you pick off the remaining few with space suits who escaped.
As an Alien, your melee prowess is unmatched, but your ranged abilities are sorely lacking. Make use of corners to force a melee confrontation!
As an Alien, you take double damage from all burn attacks, such as lasers, welding tools, and fires. Furthermore, fire can destroy your resin and eggs. Expose areas to space to starve away any flamethrower fires before they can do damage!
As an Alien, resin floors not only regenerate your plasma supply, but also passively heal you. Fight on resin floors to gain a home turf advantage!
As an Alien, the facehugger is by far your most powerful weapon because of its ability to instantly win a fight. Remember however that certain helmets, such as biohoods or space helmets will completely block facehugger attacks.
As an Alien, you are unable to pick up or use any human items or machinery. Instead, you should focus on sabotaging APCs, computers, cameras and either stowing, spacing, or melting any weapons you find.
When fighting the Blob, you can hit it with an analyzer to check its chemical effects and the type of blob analyzed. Examining it with a research scanner or medical hud active will also reveal this information.
As the Blob, you can place your core at any clear, unobserved, spot you can move to after 3 minutes have passed. If you wait too long, you will be automatically placed at a random location. Use this wait time to coordinate with any other overminds.
As the Blob, keep your core some distance from space, as it is both expensive to expand onto space, easy to be attacked from, and does not count towards your win condition. Emitter platforms built in space are especially dangerous.
As the Blob, you can randomly repick your reagent type if the crew has adapted and protected themselves against your current one.
As the Blob, you fight a war of attrition: Take out medbay and fight in chokepoints to prevent continued assaults and coordinated burst damage attacks!
As the Blob, you can attack anything next to a blob tile, but can only expand in cardinal directions, and diagonal attacks are slightly weaker.
As the Blob, don't neglect the creation of factories. These create spores that carry your reagent and can chase crewmembers far further than you. Spores can also be rallied to swarm the crew and cause panic, and can even take over corpses to create much more dangerous blob zombies!
As the Blob, you can produce a Blobbernaut from a factory for 40 resources. Blobbernauts are player-controlled, gradually regenerate near nodes, and apply your chemical when attacking, but die when too far from the blob or if their factory is killed. However, the factory used becomes fragile and stops spawning spores.
As the Blob, you can expand by clicking, create strong blobs with ctrl-click, rally spores with middle-click, and remove blobs with alt-click. You do not need to have your camera over the tile to do this.
As the Blob, removing strong blobs, resource nodes, factories, and nodes will give you 4, 15, 25, and 25 resources back, respectively.
As the Blob, talking will send a message to all other overminds and all Blobbernauts, allowing you to direct attacks and coordinate.
As a Blobbernaut, you can communicate with overminds and other Blobbernauts via :b.
As a Blobbernaut, your HUD shows your health and the core health of the overmind that created you.
As a Revolutionary, you cannot convert a head of staff or someone who has a mindshield implant, such as a security officer or those they implant. Implants can however be surgically removed, and do not carry over with cloning. Take control of medbay to keep control of conversions!
As a Revolutionary, cargo can be your best friend or your worst nightmare. In the best case scenario you will be able to order a limitless amount of guns and armor, in the worst case scenario security will take control and order a limitless number of mindshield implants to turn your fellow revolutionaries against you.
As a Revolutionary, your main power comes from who you convert, choose your converts wisely to ensure you win the round.
As a Changeling, the Extract DNA sting counts for your genome absorb objective, but does not let you respec your powers.
As a Changeling, you can absorb someone by strangling them and using the Absorb verb; this gives you the ability to rechoose your powers, the DNA of whoever you absorbed, the memory of the absorbed, and some samples of things the absorbed said.
As a Cultist, do not cause too much chaos before your objective is completed. If the shuttle gets called too soon, you may not have enough time to win.
As a Cultist, your team starts off very weak, but if necessary can quickly convert everything they have into raw power. Make sure you have the numbers and equipment to support going loud, or the cult will fall flat on its face.
As a Cultist, the Blood Boil rune will deal massive amounts of brute damage to non-cultists, and some damage to fellow cultists of Nar'Sie nearby, but will create a fire where the rune stands on use.
As a Cultist, you can create an army of manifested goons using a combination of the Manifest rune, which creates homunculi from ghosts, and the Blood Drain rune, which drains life from anyone standing on any blood drain rune.
As a Cultist, check the alert in the upper-right of your screen for all the details about your cult's current status and objective.
You can deconvert Cultists of Nar'Sie by feeding them large amounts of holy water. Unlike revolutionaries, implanting them with mindshield implants won't do it!
The Chaplain can bless any container with water by hitting it with their bible. Holy water has a myriad of uses against both cults and large amounts of it are a great contributor to success against them.
As a Wizard, you can turn people to stone, then animate the resulting statue with a staff of animation to create an extremely powerful minion, for all of 5 minutes at least.
