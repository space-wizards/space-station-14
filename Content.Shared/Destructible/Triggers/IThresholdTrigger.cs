/// Entity effects will raise a separate event for each entity and each condition, which can become a huge number
/// for cases like nuke explosions or shuttle collisions where there are lots of DamageChangedEvents at once.
/// IThresholdTriggers on the other hand are directly checked in a foreach loop without raising events.
/// And there are only few of these conditions, so there is only a minor amount of code duplication.
