///     Component for providing the means of triggering an explosive payload. Used in grenade construction.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     This component performs two functions. Firstly, it will add or remove other components to some entity when this
///     item is installed inside of it. This is intended for use with constructible grenades. For example, this allows
///     you to add things like <see cref="OnUseTimerTriggerComponent"/>, or <see cref="TriggerOnProximityComponent"/>.
///     This is required because otherwise you would have to forward arbitrary interaction directed at the casing
///     through to the trigger, which would be quite complicated. Also proximity triggers don't really work inside of
///     containers.
///
///     Secondly, if the entity that this component is attached to is ever triggered directly (e.g., via a device
///     network message), the trigger will be forwarded to the device that this entity is installed in (if any).
/// </remarks>
