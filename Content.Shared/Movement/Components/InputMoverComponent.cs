        // and then building a total movement vector based on those sub-tick steps.

        // We keep track of the last sub-tick a movement input came in,

        //   (new sub-tick - last sub-tick)
        // and then add to the total-this-tick movement vector
        // by multiplying that fraction by the movement direction for the last input.
