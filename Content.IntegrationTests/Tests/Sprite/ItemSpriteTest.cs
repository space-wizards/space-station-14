/// <summary>
/// This test checks that all items have a visible sprite. The general rationale is that all items can be picked up
/// by players, thus they need to be visible and have a sprite that can be rendered on screen and in their hands GUI.
/// This has nothing to do with in-hand sprites.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// If a prototype fails this test, its probably either because it:
/// - Should be marked abstract
/// - inherits from BaseItem despite not being an item
/// - Shouldn't have an item component
/// - Is missing the required sprite information.
/// If none of the abveo are true, it might need to be added to the list of ignored components, see
/// <see cref="Ignored"/>
