# The main reason you'd want to supply any of these manually is for a custom fork and if you have no tools.

# Useful to override if the existing version is bad.

# This is where the launcher will download the client ZIP from.
# If this isn't supplied, the server will check for a file called "Content.Client.zip",
#  and will host it on the status server.
# If that isn't available, the server will attempt to find and use "../../Resources" and
#  "../../bin/Content.Client" to automatically construct a client zip.
# It will then host this on the status server.
# Note that these paths do not work on "FULL_RELEASE" servers.
# FULL_RELEASE servers expect to be used with a specific "packaged" layout.
# As such, whatever script you're using to package them is expected to create the ZIP.
# download_url = "http://example.com/compass.zip"

# Optional in any case and automatically set if hosting a client ZIP.
# This hash is an example only.
