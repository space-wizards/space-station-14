			<h3 class="author">Iamgoofball updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes Morphine not knocking you out.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Hotline no longer exists. Poppies now have Saline-Glucose Solution.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Muriatic Acid, Caustic Soda, and Hydrogen Chloride have been removed, along with the secondary meth recipe. The original recipe still works.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Foam now produces more bang for your buck when mixed. Your foam grenades should be larger now to account for the slowdown.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Stabilizing Agent. This chemical will prevent the effects of certain reactions from taking place in  the container it is in, such as Smoke Powder and Flash Powder, allowing you to get the raw forms of the powders for heating up later.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Smoke Powder and Flash Powder can now be mixed along with Stabilizing Agent in order to produce a powder version of the effects. You can then heat these powders to 374K to get the effects.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mixing them without Stabilizing Agent gives the default effects.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Sonic Powder, a chemical that deafens and stuns within 5 tiles of the reaction. It also follows the reaction rules of the other 2 powders.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Liquid Dark Matter and Sorium also now work like the powders do.</li>
				<li class="tweak">CLF3 now has a higher chance of making plating tiles, and the burn damage caused by it scales based on your fire stacks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Pyrosium. This reagent heats up mobs by 30 degrees every 3 seconds if it has oxygen to react with. Useful for when you want a delayed mix inside of someone.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Cryostylane.  This reagent does the opposite of Pyrosium, but it still requires oxygen to react with.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Phlogiston. This reagent ignites you and gives you a single fire stack every 3 seconds. Burn damage from this chemical scales up with the fire stacks you have. Counter this with literally any chemical that purges other chems.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Smoke now transfers reagents to the mob, and applies touch reactions on them. This means smoke can run out of reagents, no more infinite acid smoke. It also only works on mobs, use the new Reagent Foam(tm) for your hellfoam needs. I suggest a CLF3 Fluoroacid Black Powder mix.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Added a derelict medibot to the code, will place a few on the derelict when this PR is merged as to prevent mapping conflicts.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Initropidril. 33% chance to hit with 5-25 TOX damage every 3 seconds, and a 5-10% chance to either stun, cause lots of oxygen damage, or cause your heart to stop. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Pancuronium. Paralyses you after 30 seconds, with a 7% chance to cause 3-5 loss of breath. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Sodium Thiopental. Knocks you out after 30 seconds, and destroys your stamina. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Sulfonal. +1 TOX per 3 seconds, knocks you out in 66 seconds. Mix it with Acetone, Diethylamine, and Sulfur.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Amantin. On the last second it is in you, it hits you with a stack of TOX damage based on how long it's been in you. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Lipolicide. +1 TOX unless you have nutriment in you. Mix it with Mercury, Diethylamine, and Ephedrine.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Coiine. +2 TOX and +5 loss of breath every 3 seconds. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Curare. +1 TOX, +1 OXY, paralyzes after 33 seconds. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds a reagent_deleted() proc to reagents for effects upon the last time it processes in you, like with Amantin.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Neurotoxin required temperature for mixing has been set to 674K, it was 370K for some reason.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">After the years of extensive research into xenobiology, and thousands of scientists lost to the slimes, we have finally come to admitting that we don't have a clue how they work. However, we've outlined a few facts, and managed to breed a new kind of slimes. They will be shipped to your station on the next shifts. They are different from the ones they are used to in the following:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Their sight is better than ever, and now they can finally see things that are not directly pressed against them. Beware, they may appear more aggressive!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Their memory has also become better, and they will now remember the people who fed them. As a note, you need to grab the monkey or push it to show to the slime that you're giving it to them, and it's not just walking in.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Apparently, not only we have studied them, but they have also studied us. Slimes are now capable of showing various emotions, mimicking humans. Use it to your advantage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There are reports of slimes showing signs of sentience. Further research is recommended.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">One of the reported signs is their speech capability. Following facts have been gathered: they talk more often to those who feed them; they react to being called by the number, but 'slimes' is also acceptable; they are able to understand being ordered to "follow" someone, or "stop". There is a report of slime releasing the assistant after a scientist shouted at it, and then calmly ordered a slime to stop.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">DNA scanner: Laser quality lessens irradiation. Manipulator quality drastically improves precision (9x for best part) and scanner quality allows you to scan suicides/ling husks, with the best part enabling the cloner's autoprocess button, making it scan people in the scanner automatically.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Clone pod: Manipulator quality improves the speed of cloning. Scanning module quality affects with how much health people will be ejected, will they get negative mutation/no mutations/clean of all mutations/random good mutation, at best quality will enable clone console's autoprocess button and will try to clone all the dead people in records automatically, together with best DNA scanner parts cloning console will be able to work in full automatic regime autoscanning people and autocloning them.</li>

Redone how reliability is handled, you now see item reliability in the deconstruction menu and deconstructing items that has same or one point less research type level will rise the reliability of all known designs that has one or more research type requirements as the deconstructed item. Designs of the same type raise in reliability more. Critically broken things rise reliability of the design drastically.

		Unstable anomalies have been spotted in your region of space. These anomalies can be hazardous and destructive, though our initial encounters with these space oddities has discovered a method of neutralization. Method follows.<br>
		<p>Step 1. Upon confirmation of an anomaly sighting, report its location. Early detection is key.<br>
		Step 2. Using an atmospheric analyzer at short range, determine the frequency that the anomaly's core is fluctuating at.</br>
		Step 3. Send a signal through the frequency using a radio signaller. Note that non-specialized signaller devices may possibly lack the frequency range needed.<br></p>
		With the anomaly neutralized and the station brought out of danger, inspect the area for any remnants of the anomaly. Properly researched, we believe these events could provide vast amounts of valuable data.<br>

This totals to 6 minutes, in hope that it will give our <b>very expensive equipment</b> a better chance of recovery.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">The return of the Nanotrasen Scripting Language! (NTSL) If you haven't heard of NTSL, it is a scripting language within a game for telecomms. Yes, you can create scripts to interact with the radio! For more information, head here: http://wiki.nanotrasen.com/index.php?title=NT_Script But before you do, if you are not an antag, do not create bad scripts which hinders communication.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">Simplified detective stuff. The high-res scanner is gone and instead the detective's normal scanner will instantly report all fingerprints, dna and cloth fibers in full. This was needed because the system took too long to work with and disencouraged detectives. Not only that, it made detectives less of a threat for antagonists and made possible scenerios, such as framing someone by changing fingerprints with someone else, impratical. To replace the computer, the detective will have a full medical computer with access to it. Not only that, but his useless filing cabinet will be replaced with an empty one for serious investigators. Along with this, are fingerprint cards and built-in PDA scanning, as all of security had access to it which was really the detective's thing. The new scanner will also log every finding and you can print them out as a report by clicking the scanner while it is in your active hand.</li>

		Lots of changes. This is just a brief summary of the most recent changes; still working on proper documentation.<br>
		All admins have access to view-vars, player-panel(for individual mobs), game panel and secrets panel. Most of the things on those pages have their own rights requirements. For instance, you can only use event orientated secrets in the secret panel if you have FUN rights. Debug secrets if you have DEBUG rights. etc.<br>
		Spawn xeno and toggle gravity procs were moved into the secrets panel (fun).<br>
		<a href='http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/source/browse/trunk/config/admin_ranks.txt'>This</a> may help with understanding which flags do what. Unfortuanately it's still somewhat vague.<br>

		<li class="rscadd">-Changes flour from an item to a container-held reagent. All recipes have been updated to use 5 units of reagent flour for every item required previously.   This has a few advantages: The 16(!) sacks of flour previously in the kitchen cabinet have been condensed to an equivalent 3 sacks. Beer is now brewable with universal enzyme, and converting lots of wheat into flour should be less tedious. Also, flour grenades, etc.  Because of this, flour is now obtained from the all-in-one blender rather than the processor, and spaghetti noodles are made with 5 units of flour in the microwave.</li>

The construction and deconstruction for them has also changed, so look it up or experiment it with yourself to see how to setup the cameras now. Cameras also get wires, like airlocks and APCs.

		<li class="rscadd">pAI gets a better PDA that can actually receive messages from people. They can also instantly reply like everybody else now and they can toggle their receiver/signaller/ringer.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">You can show the AI the notes on your PDA by holding it up to a camera. When you show up a paper/pda to the camera the AI can now click on your name to go to you, if you're near a camera. People who are Unknown will not have a link; which would've allowed the AI to track them.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Made the" common server" and the "preset right receiver" listen for frequencies 144.1 to 148.9. This will allow people to use different frequencies to talk to eachother without bothering the common channel. It will also allow Revs and Cultists to work with each other; everything is still logged though so it still has risks.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Increased the maximum frequency limit for handheld radios and intercoms. It will give you the option to just use station bounced radios on a higher frequency so that anyone with a headset can't simply tune in.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Created an All-In-One Grinder that is suppose to replace the blender, juicer and reagent grinder all together. Meaning any department that has a juicer, blender and grinder will instead get this. It will help people be more independent from Chemistry by recycling foods and plants.</li>

		<p>These devices can be used to quickly create an air-tight seal across a hull breach until repairs can been made.
		<p>Wrench them in place and activate them near a hull breach. The shield should extend to all space tiles in range.
		<p>They can be (un)locked by engineering IDs and can also be emagged and otherwise malfunction. As they can not be constructed, you can repair damage and malfunctions by opening the panel with a screwdriver and replacing the wires with a cable coil</li>

These changes do not directly affect players; HOWEVER, bugs, oversights or simple mistakes may cause problems for players. While I have tested as much as I can, there may be some lingering bugs I have missed. <p> This part of the mob code cleanup mainly focuses on damage variables and procs. So if you suspect something related to taking, dealing or examining damage is not working as intended please fill out an issue report <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/issues/list">here</a> and be as detailed as possible.

		<li class="rscadd">Alien hunters will now cloak when using the 'stalk' movement intent. Whilst cloaked they will use up their plasma reserves. They can however cloak as long as they like. Using the Lay-down verb will allow them to remain cloaked without depleting their plasma reserves,  hence allowing them to lay ambushes for unsuspecting prey. Should a hunter attack anybody, or get knocked down in any way,  they will become visible. Hopefully this allows for more strategic/stealthy gameplay from aliens. On the other hand, I may have totally  screwed the balance so feedback/other-ideas are welcome.</li>

The systems replaced were causing immense performance issues so the following are very necessary optimisations.<br>However, there is a downside: SS13 code is the equivilant of monkeys on typewriters. Despite weeks of constant coding/testing there -will- be things I've missed. The kinds of bugs I'm expecting are overlays not updating and/or in rare cases things not appearing in your hud. Most of these issues can be worked around simply by dropping the item and picking it back up. If all else fails ask an admin to regenerate your icons through view-vars.<br><u>Please</u> report any bugs to me on <b>#coderbus IRC</b> or <b>make an issue on the tracker</b> as a matter of urgency. I will fix them ASAP.<br>Also a massive thankyou to Nodrak, Erro, Pete and Willox. :)</font></li>
		<li class="tweak">Massive rewrite of the overlays system (particularly for humans). Stuff is cached and only updates when necessary. In effect this means faster updates, less overheads/lag, and less reliance on the game-ticker.</li>

		<li>Dismemberment was ported from Bay12, but only halfway, and there were several problems with it. I know many people really liked it, but as it stood it did not fit the playstyle here at all. This <b>had</b> to be removed, there is work on a more fitting system, but this had to be taken out first regardless, and the longer people beat around the bush the worse the situation got.</li>
		<li>The gun change was made for no real reason and was pretty problematic, so reverting that should mean there are a lot less 'accidental suicides.'</li>

		<li class="wip">CONTRABAND-CON UPDATE: Added posters. I'm sorry to add it seperately with the rest of contraband, but there was a lack of sprites for everything else. Hopefully, people will gain interest and get me some damn sprites this way :3

                <BR><BR>How they get on-board: The quartermaster can now set the receiver frequency of his supplycomp circuit board. A bit simplistic as of now, will work on it later. Building a supplycomp with a properly set up circuitboard will give access to the Contraband crate.
                <BR><BR>How they're used: Unfold the rolled poster on any wall or r_wall to create the poster. There are currently 17 designs, with the possibility of me adding more.
                <BR><BR>How to get rid of them: You can rip them using your hand... To cleanly extract them and not ruin them for future use, however, you can use a pair of wirecutters.
                <BR><BR>How they're classified: They're contraband, so it's perfectly okay for security officers to confiscate them. Punishment for contraband-providers (or end-users, if you want to go full nazi) is up to the situational commanding officers.

	<li>What <b>ARE</b> newscasters? Fans of the Transmetropolitan series might find them familiar. Basically, they're terminals connected to a station-wide news network. Users are able to submit channels of their own (one per identified user, with channels allowing feed stories by other people or, if you want the channel to be your very own SpaceJournal, being submit-locked to you), while others are able to read the channels, either through the terminals or a printed newspaper which contains every news-story circulating at the time of printing.</li>
	<li>About censorship: You can censor channels and feed stories through Security casters, found in the HoS'es office and the Bridge. Alternatively, if you want a channel to stop operating completely, you can mark it with a D-Notice which will freeze it and make all its messages unreadable for the duration it is in effect.

	<li>Basically I think of the newscaster as nothing more as an additional Roleplaying tool. Grab a newspaper along with your donuts and coffee from the machines, read station rumors when you're manning your desk, be a station adventurer or journalist with your very own network journal!</li>
	<li>I would ask for a bit of respect when using the machine, though. I removed all and any channel and story restrictions regarding content, so you might end up seeing channels that violate the rules, Report those to the admins.</li>
	<li>Finally, due to the removal of the enforced "Channel" string, it's recommended to name your channels properly ("Station Paranormal Activity Channel" instead of "Station Paranormal Activity", for example")

	<ul>
		<li>I was always bothered by how unprofessional it was of Nanotransen (in before >Nanotransen >professionalism) to just lay expensive spacesuits in racks and just let them be. Well, no more. Introducing...</li>
		<li>Suit Storage Units. Rumored to actually be repurposed space radiators, these wondrous machines will store any kind of spacesuit in a clean and sterile environment.</li>
		<li>The user can interact with the unit in various ways. You can start a UV cauterisation cycle to disinfect its contents, effectively sterilising and cleaning eveyrthing from the suits/helmets stored inside.</li>
		<li>A sneaky yordle can also hide in it, if he so desires, or hack it, or lock it or do a plethora of shady stuff with it. Beware, though, there's plenty of dangerous things you can do with it, both to you and your target.</li>
		<li>The Unit's control panel can be accessed by screwdriving it. That's all I'm willing to say, I'd like to let the players find out what each hack option does and doesn't. Will add more stuff later.</li>
		<li>Added Command Space suit, Chief Engineer space suit and Chief Medical Officer spacesuit (In a new space that you'll probably notice by yourself) to make it easier for you to look like a special snowflake.</li>
		<li>EVA and CMO office modified to accomodate the new suits and SSUs. Look, I'm not a competent mapper, okay? Fuck you too. A mapper is strongly recommended to rearrange my half assed shit.</li>
		<li>Soda cans, cigarette packets, cigarettes and cigars as well as bullet casings are now considered trash and can be picked up by the trashbag. Now you can annoy the janitor even more!</li>
		<li>Sprite credit goes to Alex Jones, his portfolio can be found here: <a href="http://bspbox.com/">http://bspbox.com</a>. Thanks a lot, bro.</li>

		<li>Backpacks removed from all players. It was unrealistic. You can now had to the living quarters to get one from the personal closets there.</li>
		<li>Any firearms now send you to critical in 1-2 shots. Doctors need to get the wounded man to surgery to provide good treatment. Guide for bullet removal is up on the wiki.</li>
		<li>Brute packs and kelotane removed altogether to encourage use of surgery for heavy injury.</li>
		<li>Just kidding</li>
		<li>Fireaxe cabinets and Extinguisher wall-mounted closets now added around the station, thank Nanotransen for that.</li>
		<li>Because of Nanotransen being Nanotransen, the fire cabinets are electrically operated. AIs can lock them and you can hack them if you want the precious axe inside and it's locked. The axe itself uses an experimental two-handed system, so while it's <u><font color='red'>FUCKING ROBUST</u></font> you need to wield it to fully unlock its capabilities. Pick up axe and click it in your hand to wield it, click it again or drop to unwield and carry it.You can also use it as a crowbar for cranking doors and firedoors open when wielded, utilising the lever on the back of the blade. And I didn't lie to you. It's fucking robust.</li>
		<li>Fireaxe, when wielded, fully takes up your other hand as well. You can't switch hands and the fireaxe itself is unwieldy and won't fit anywhere. 
		<li>A fireaxe cabinet can also be smashed if you've got a strong enough object in your hand.<li>
		<li><b>EXTINGUISHER CLOSETS</b>, made by dear Erro, can be found in abundance around the station. Click once to open them, again to retrieve the extinguisher, attack with extinguisher to place it back. Limited uses, but we've got plans for our little friend.

	<LI>The amount of power the station uses should be lower.
	<LI>The singularity now changes size based upon how much energy it has
	<LI>New Machine: Particle Accelerator.
	<LI>It might need a better name/sprite but when put together properly and turned on it will shoot Accelerated Particles.

	<LI>New layout for Engineering, might be changed up slightly in the next few days.
</ul>
	
<h5>06.02.2011, r979</h5>
<ul>
	<LI>Jesus christ it's a new map what the fuck
	<LI>Just kidding, it's only minor changes to medbay/mechbay/cybernetics/R&amp;D/toxins/robotics/chapel/theatre
	<LI>Okay so there's too many changes to list completely, but basically: toxins/R&amp;D/virology/xenobiology are south <i>through</i> medbay; robotics/cybernetics/mechbay are where toxins used to be, the theatre and chapel are above medbay.
	<LI>Theatre is a new place for the Clown and Mime to play, there are some costumes available, a stage and backstage, and seating for the audience.
	<LI>R&amp;D and Toxins have been combined together. R&amp;D is still work in progress. You need to head south through medbay to get there.
	<LI>Medbay has been re-arranged slightly. Honestly, it's nothing, I bet you won't even notice anything different. There's also a new surgery suite, complete with pre-op and post-op rooms. 
	<LI>Virology's been rearranged, but it is mostly in the same place still.
	<LI>Xenobiology is work in progress. [There's some fun stuff still being coded]
	<LI>The Chapel is now to the north. You'll probably be thinking something like "Goddamn, this place is fucking huge", but it's actually smaller than the previous chapel.
	<LI>Robotics and related stuff is also work in progress - however, everything needed for making borgs is there. Note: de-braining will now be done by surgeons in medbay, rather than roboticists in robotics, in case you're wondering where your optable went.
	<LI>I added color-coded pipes in the areas I was working on. Red pipes run from air siphons and feed into the waste loop; blue pipes run from air vents and pump whatever atmos is set to pump. Yeah, there's TWO pipe networks on the station, who knew? Well, some of you probably did, but I didn't!
	<LI>Please bring all complaints/ideas/suggestions/bugfixes to: <a href="http://tgstation13.servehttp.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=14971#p14971">This awesome thread on our forums</a>
	<LI>This update brought to you by: veyveyr and Rookie, with help from friends! [Now you know who to strangle, please be gentle q_q]
</ul>

<h5>05.02.2011, r968</h5>
<ul>
	<LI>This really needs to be updated more often.
	<LI>Various map updates have been applied with many more to come. Expect overhauls! 
	<LI>Mining system nearing completion.
	<LI>Massive overhaul to the electricity systems, the way singularity makes power, and various related functions.
	<LI>Mime spawns with White Gloves instead of Latex Gloves (apparently there's a difference!)
	<LI>A new event has been- CLANG! What the fuck was that?
	<LI>Ion storm laws should be much more interesting.
	<LI>Security reports should no longer list traitor heads/AIs as possible revs/cultists, nor should nuke operatives ever get named for anything.
	<LI>Pens are much more versatile and user friendly.
	<LI>Mech building is rapidly on its way! Ripleys can be built, consult your quartermasters.
	<LI>Traitors now have several new things they can steal.
	<LI>Some surgeries coded to accompany the new operating room and surgery tools.
	<LI>Research and Design is continuing development and should be rolled out shortly.
	<LI>Various sprites added, tweaked, scrapped and fixed.
</ul>

Both venoms removed. Several "Dart" abiliites added. They allow the changling to deafen, blind, mute, paralyze, or even transform (dead) targets.

	<LI>Chaplains can now name their religion at round start.

	<LI>Alium Overhaul. Divided into multiple castes with distinct abilities.
	<LI>New AI Modules: The goody two-shoes P.A.L.A.D.I.N. module and it's evil twin T.Y.R.A.N.T. Only the former actually spawns on the station.
	<LI>Lizards added. They run away and shit.
