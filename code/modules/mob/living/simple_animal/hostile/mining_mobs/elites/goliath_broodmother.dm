/**
  * # Goliath Broodmother
  *
  * A stronger, faster variation of the goliath.  Has the ability to spawn baby goliaths, which it can later detonate at will.
  * When it's health is below half, tendrils will spawn randomly around it.  When it is below a quarter of health, this effect is doubled.
  * It's attacks are as follows:
  * - Spawns a 3x3/plus shape of tentacles on the target location
  * - Spawns 2 baby goliaths on its tile, up to a max of 8.  Children blow up when they die.
  * - The broodmother lets out a noise, and is able to move faster for 6.5 seconds.
  * - Summons your children around you.
  * The broodmother is a fight revolving around stage control, as the activator has to manage the baby goliaths and the broodmother herself, along with all the tendrils.
