# Space Station 14 Code of Conduct

Like the technical community as a whole, the Space Station 14 team and community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission - including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to all levels of the project, from commenters to contributors to staff.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies specifically to the Github repositories and its spaces managed by the Space Station 14 project or Space Wizards Federation. Some spaces, such as the SS14 Discord or the official Wizard's Den game servers, have their own rules but are in spirit equal to what may be found in here. 

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by contacting a Maintainer, Project Manager or Wizard staff member through [Discord](https://discord.ss14.io/), [the forums](https://forum.spacestation14.com/), or emailing [telecommunications@spacestation14.com](mailto:telecommunications@spacestation14.com). 

- **Be friendly and patient.** 
- **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
- **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Space Station 14 community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Space Station 14 community.
- **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to: 
 - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
 - Discriminatory jokes and language.
 - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
 - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
 - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
 - Unwelcome sexual attention.
 - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
 - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
- **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Space Station 14 is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of Space Station 14 comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

## On Comunity Moderation

Deviating from the Code of Conduct on the Github repository may result in moderative actions taken by project Maintainers. This can involve your content being edited or deleted, and may result in a temporary or permanent block from the repository.

This is to ensure SS14 is a healthy community in which contributors feel encouraged and empowered to contribute, and to give you as a member of this community a chance to reflect on how you are interacting with it. While outright offensive and bigoted content will *always* be unacceptable on the repository, Maintainers are at liberty to take moderative actions against more ambiguous content that fail to provide constructive criticism, or that provides constructive criticism in a non-constructive manner. Examples of this include using hyperbole, bringing up PRs/changes unrelated to the discussion at hand, hostile tone, off-topic comments, creating PRs/Issues for the sole purpose of causing discussions, skirting the line of acceptable behavior, etc. Maintainers are expected to adhere to the guidelines as listed in the [Github Moderation Guidelines](https://docs.spacestation14.com/en/general-development/github-moderation-guidelines.html), though may deviate should they feel it's in the best interest of the community. If you believe you had an action incorrectly applied against you, you are encouraged to contact staff via [Discord](https://discord.ss14.io/) or [the forums](https://forum.spacestation14.com/), appeal your Github ban [on the forums](https://forum.spacestation14.com/c/ban-appeals/appeals-github/38), or make a [staff complaint](https://forum.spacestation14.com/t/staff-complaint-instructions-and-info/31).
