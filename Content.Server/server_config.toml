# Welcome to the example configuration file for Space Station 14!
# If you are in a watchdog enviroment, please create config.toml in your instence's root directory instead of editing this.

# This configuration file contains **some popular** options most often changed by sandboxers and server hosts.
# Along with a description of what they do. Look at the end of the file for a list of all options available if it's not listed here.
