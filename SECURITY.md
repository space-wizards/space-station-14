# Reporting a security vulnerability
You can report a security vulnerability through Discord or through email.

If you want to send an email, you can contact us at <support@spacestation14.com>.
If you want to contact us through Discord, you can join [our server](https://discord.gg/MwDDf6t)
and then **privately** message anyone with the `@Wizard` or `@SS14 Maintainer` role.

In either case, **do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we explicitly give
you permission to do so**.
