## Trieste Port

Trieste Port is a fork of Space Station 14, taking place on an ocean planet instead of a nanotrasen space station. It shares many similarities with the main servers like Wizden, but focuses more on life aboard a frontier ocean city and less on corporate gain. Enjoy the chaos, exploration and adventure aboard the platform and deep sea below!
